Heterotrophy • What is heterotrophy…? The ingestion of food in order to satisfy energy requirements.  Small particles Pseudopodial: Protozoa Ciliate: bivalve molluscs, marine invertebrate larvae Tentacular: cnidarians/annelids/bryozoa Mucoid: tunicates Setous: crustaceans, baleen whales, flamingos etc. Deposit: annelids HeterotrophyHeterotrophy  Large particles Scraping/boring: gastropod molluscs Seizure of prey: carnivores Traps: spiders webs, pits etc.  Fluid feeding Sucking without penetration: honey bees, humming birds Sucking with penetration: leeches, ticks etc. HeterotrophyHeterotrophy  Direct absorption Absorption across body surface: endoparasites, aquatic invertebrates etc. Absorption from symbiotic partners: corals, ruminants etc. Small Particles: Phagocytosis • Phagocytosis is the simplest form of food capture. • Form pseudopodia and then create a food vacuole or phagosome. • Lysosomes fuse to create a phagolysosome. • Waste excrete via the anal pore. Small Particles: Ciliate Feeding • Bivalves use cilia on their gills to trap suspended particles. • Particles transported down to the food groove. • Three types of cilia:  Frontal.  Lateral.  Laterofrontal. Small Particles: Mucous nets • Tunicata use an iodine rich mucus nets secreted by their endostyle. • Cilia line the stigmata and create a water current. • Mucus traps very small particles. • Periodically ingested.http://www.asnailsodyssey.com/LEARNABOUT/TUNICATE/tuniFood.php Small Particles: Setae • Arthropods do not have cilia they use setae on specialised appendages. • Projections of the exoskeleton. • Trap particles suspended in the water column and pass to the mouth. Maxilliped Small Particles: Gill Rakers • Gill rakers have evolved in suspension feeding fish. • Water drawn into the buccal cavity and over the gills particles are trapped on the rakers. • Not involved in gaseous exchange. • Teleosts, elasmobranchs etc. Small Particles: Baleen Plates • Baleen plates have evolved in suspension feeding whales: Mysticeti. • Composed of keratin. • Inner edge frayed to form a fibrous mat. • Water taken in from the front and out laterally. • Tongue wipes the plates. Small Particles: Deposit Feeding • Deposit feeding is the ingestion of organic matter from the sea floor/soil. • Gain nutrition from POM and microorganisms. • Subsurface or surface feeders. • Non-selective or selective feeders. • Bioturbation. • Arenicola marina Bioturbation • Bioturbation is the reworking of the top 5-10 cm of sediment • As the result of feeding, burrow construction and maintenance, respiration, burrowing etc. • Increase the organic matter (nitrogen), facilitate species interaction, increase water content, alterations in sediment biogeochemistry etc. Large Particles: Rasping Radula • Gastropods have a radula which is used to scrape/rasp the surface of their food. • Modified into drills or harpoons. https://www.youtube.c om/watch?v=V0zzti4Ub as Large Particles: Carnivory • Arthropods use modified chelate legs and pedipalps to capture prey. • Dorsal dactylus and ventral propus. • Handedness: crushing and cutting chelae. • Consume molluscs etc. • Chelicerata have chelate pedipalps. Large Particles: Traps • Some invertebrates utilize traps to capture passing prey:  Slime: Turbellaria  Silk: Chelicerata  Pits: Myrmeleontidae Large Particles: Vertebrates • Evolutionary adaptations of vertebrate digestive systems correlate with diet. • Many vertebrates have:  Modified craniodental modifications.  Stomach and intestinal adaptations.  Mutualistic adaptations. Large Particles: Hagfish • Hagfish, Myxini, marine scavengers. • Tentacles surround the mouth for detecting prey. • 2 plates in mouth that bear sharp tooth-like structures. • When mouth is open they spread apart, mouth closed fold together and teeth interdigitate. • Tie a knot in tail and pass forward to assist in leverage. Large Particles: Chrondrichthyes • Elasmobranchs have evolved an array of feeding strategies: filter feeding to carnivory. • Cranial kinesis: motility within the head skeleton enables the consumption of large prey items. • Hyostylic jaw suspension: allows the jaw to be placed into multiple positions and protrusion of the upper jaw. • Palatoquadrate: upper jaw • Mandible: lower jaw. Large Particles: Chrondrichthyes • Teeth on palatoquadrate large, serrated and recurved. • Teeth sunk into prey by protruding upper jaw. • Lateral undulations of body moves head and rips flesh. • Electroreceptors: ampullae of Lorenzini. Large Particles: Actinopterygii • Evolution of specialisation of the jaw directly related to diet. • Protrusible pharyngeal jaws very important in this group. • Diversity of feeding methods from simple prey grabbing to specialised suction devices. • Evolved 3 or 4 times in different teleost clades. Fluid Feeding • There is two types of fluid feeding:  Feeding without penetration: hummingbirds, bees, butterflies, some bats etc.  Feeding with penetration: flies, leeches, ticks, aphids etc. • Requires specialised mouth parts. Feeding via Symbionts • Symbiosis is (beneficial) relationship between two closely associated organisms. • Symbionts can be:  Autotrophic chemosynthetic e.g. Riftia and thioautotrophic bacteria and photosynthetic e.g. corals and zooxanthellae.  Heterotrophic e.g. ruminants. Autotrophic Symbionts • Photoautotrophic symbiosis is very common to marine invertebrates. • Two types:  Zooxanthellae: dinoflagellate Symbiodinium microadriaticum.  Zoochlorellae: green alga Zoochlorella parasitica. • Enables the tight recycling of nutrients in an otherwise very unproductive environment. Autotrophic SymbiontsHeterotrophic Symbionts • Vertebrates cannot digest cellulose, many rely on fermentation by microbes. • Three main groups:  Foregut – ruminants including cattle, sheep, giraffes and those non-ruminants including kangaroos, sloths etc.  Midgut – herbivorous and omnivorous fish including tilapia, carp etc.  Hindgut – rabbits, horses, elephants, ostriches etc. Herbivore Foregut Fermenters • Less craniodental specialisations. • Slow fermentation – allows for ingestion of moderately fibrous food. • Multi-chambered stomach: rumen, reticulum, omasum – for storage and microbial processing. • Abomasum – for digestion. Heterotrophic Symbionts • The rumen is an anoxic and non-acidic fluid environment. • Plays several very important roles:  Vit B synthesis and essential amino acids.  Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs): acetic, propionic and butyric acids.  Urea – ammonia – nitrogen source for proteins. Heterotrophic Symbionts • Hindgut fermenters have a simple stomach and enlarged caecum or colon. • Microbial breakdown of cellulose to produce SCFAs. • Several problems with hindgut fermentation:  Vitamin B and essential amino acids not absorbed/digested.  Nitrogen recycling cannot occur. • Coprophagy or chewing. Heterotrophic Symbionts • Fast fermentation- allows for ingestion of very fibrous food. • Ancestral vertebrate condition? Nutrition The Need to Feed • Animal’s diet must supply the chemical energy (ATP), organic molecules for biosynthesis, and essential nutrients. • Requirements for the biosynthesis of complex molecules: chemical energy (ATP), organic carbon and nitrogen. • Some compounds cannot be synthesised and are deemed essential. • Includes: amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins and minerals The Need to Feed: Amino Acids • Animals cannot create essential amino acids, must be obtained through the diet. • Approx. 20-22 amino acids are required for the synthesis of all proteins in animals. • 8-10 are essential. • Animal products: “complete”. • Plant products: “incomplete”. The Need to Feed: Fatty Acids • Animals cannot create essential fatty acids, must be obtained through the diet. • Fatty acid deficiency very rare. • Mammals cannot create the double bonds at omega-3 and -6 positions, must be obtained from diet. • Met by the consumption of ɑ- linolenic acid and linoleic acid. The Need to Feed: Vitamins • Animals cannot create vitamins, must be obtained through the diet. • Organic molecules required in small amounts. • Diverse functions: cofactors for enzymes etc. • Divide into two groups:  Fat soluble: vit A, D, E & K.  Water soluble: B complex & C. The Need to Feed: Minerals • Animals cannot create minerals, must be obtained through the diet. • Inorganic molecules required in small amounts: <1 mg to ~2500 mg. • Diverse functions: cofactors for enzymes, metalloproteins etc.  Ca & P for bone building and maintenance.  Ca for nerve function.  Fe for haemoglobin and cytochromes.

Phylum CnidariaPhylum Cnidaria • Gastrodermis composed of four cell types. • Enzymatic gland cells – protolytic enzymes. • Nutritive muscular cells – ingest food via pseudopodia. • Mucous gland cells. • Nerve cells – fewer in number. Phylum Platyhelminthes • Platyhelminthes have a mouth from which extends a muscular protrusible pharynx. • Food is taken up through the pharynx into the gastrovascular cavity. • Can be unbranched or have many lobes. • Enzymes released by cells; extracellular digestion. • Many of the Platyhelminthes are parasites including Taenia – tapeworm. • They have no sensory organs, or gut (inc. mouth)! • Head has hooks and suckers to cling to the wall of the intestine. • Absorbs food passing through the hosts intestine. Phylum Platyhelminthes Through-Gut and Extracellular Digestion • As volume increases they require a greater SA for absorption and digestion. • The majority of animals have a through-gut, staring with a mouth and terminating at the anus. • It allows for specialization of the gut into various structures including stomach, intestine etc. • Efficient digestion and absorption. Food Processing Ingestion Digestion Absorption & Assimilation Egestion Enzymes (in) Soluble products (out) Insoluble food in via the mouth. Chewing/mastication starts the digestion process. Mechanical and chemical digestion via enzymes. Soluble product taken across the gut wall and assimilated. Undigested material ejected as faeces. Phylum Annelida • Consume decaying OM. • Specialized compartments along the alimentary canal.  Mouth.  Pharynx.  Oesophagus.  Crop.  Gizzard.  Intestine: typhlosole  Anus. Phylum Arthropoda • Insect: crop and gizzard; ceca (principle site of digestion and symbionts), Malpighian tubules; rectum etc. • Crustacean: anterior (cardiac) stomach, posterior (pyloric) stomach; hepatopancreas (digestion, storage and toxin sequestration), ceca; hindgut etc. Vertebrate Digestive System • The vertebrate digestive system is divided into 4 component parts:  Headgut: mouth, tongue and pharynx. Capture/engulfment and preparation of food for digestion.  Foregut: oesophagus & stomach (crop & gizzard). Move food – headgut to stomach and start mechanical digestion.  Midgut: small intestine. Main site of chemical digestion and absorption.  Hindgut: large intestine. Absorbs water and minerals, storage of waste prior to defecation. • Hagfish have a unique adaptation wrt their digestion. • Food is enclosed within a mucoid bag which is secreted by the gut wall. • Membrane is permeable to enzymes and digestive products. Phylum Chordata (Class Myxini) • Indigestible material are excreted in the membrane. • Functional significance unknown. • Diversification of the alimentary canal related to diet. • Use pharyngeal teeth to masticate their food. Phylum Chordata (Actinopterygii) • Stomach specialised: straight, U, Y or missing. • Pyloric caeca at the start of midgut. • Diffuse pancreas. A. Rainbow trout – carnivore. Phylum Chordata (Actinopterygii) B. Catfish – omnivore specialising in animal sources. C. Carp - omnivore specialising in plant sources. D. Milkfish – microphagous planktivore. Phylum Chordata (Class Aves) • Specialisation of the oesophagus: crop.  Crop: storage, transportation of food and “crop milk” • Stomach: proventriculus and the gizzard. • Small intestine: chemical digestion. • Ceca at the junction between the small and large intestines. Phylum Chordata (Class Aves) • Seasonal variation in the alimentary canal related to changes in diet.  Longer intestines: plant material, requires longer time to digest, more time for enzyme and symbiont action.  Smaller intestines: animal material, requires less time to digest. • Cloaca: waste storage and water reabsorption, formation of uric acid. • Hoatzin (Opisthocomus hoazin) – foregut fermenter. Mammalian Alimentary CanalMammalian Digestive System • There are other components that play an essential role in digestion and absorption.  Pancreas: secretes digestive enzymes, important in protein breakdown.  Biliary system: secretes bile, neutralises acid and emulsifies fats.  Muscular activity: peristalsis and segmentation, moving (and regulating) food through the alimentary canal and mechanical digestion. Chemical Digestion • Digestion is the breakdown of food molecules by the action of enzymes into constituent parts that are then absorbed. • Requires enzymes: hydrolytic.  Intraluminal: secreted into lumen; disperse freely with food.  Membrane associated: attached to the epithelia cell membrane; food in contact with the cell.  Intracellular: inside the cells; food must be taken into the cytoplasm. Chemical Digestion: Carbohydrates • Carbohydrate digestion often requires 2 enzymes. • Amylase breaks down starch to form the disaccharide maltose and isomaltose. • Maltose broken down into glucose via maltase. • Disaccharidases: sucrase, lactase, trehalase etc. Chemical Digestion: Proteins • Protein breakdown requires multiple enzymes: endopeptidases and exopeptidases. • Zymogen or proenzymes: inactive precursor. • Pepsins are released by the stomach as pepsinogens. • Pancreatic enzymes:  Endopeptidases: trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase and collagenase.  Exopeptidases: carboxypeptidases A & B. Chemical Digestion: Proteins • The intraluminal enzymes breakdown the proteins into free amino acids and oligopeptides. • Oligopeptides are further broken down via membrane associated enzymes. • Finally intracellular peptidases complete the digestion and absorption process. Chemical Digestion: Lipids • Fewer types of enzymes are required. • Problem: enzymes work in water, lipids are insoluble! • Bile contains no enzymes but contains sodium hydrogen carbonate to neutralise acid, and bile salts to emulsify fats. • Pancreatic lipases: intraluminal action.  Fats and oils (triacylglycerols): free fatty acids, glycerol and 2- monoacylglycerols.  Cholesterol and phospholipids: require phospholipases and esterases in addition to lipases. • Over the course of three hours we have covered the following topics relating to feeding and digestion in animals…. To Recap….  Types of food acquisition in animals.  Nutrition and the requirement to feed.  The diversity of the alimentary canal in animals and its evolution.  Chemical breakdown of food within the alimentary canal – relating to vertebrates.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
