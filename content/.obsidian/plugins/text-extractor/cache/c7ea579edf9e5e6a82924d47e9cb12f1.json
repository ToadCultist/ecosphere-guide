Introduction & academic skills • 2. Sources • Writing • IP and Referencing • AI • 4. Generating and presenting data • 5. Teamworking and giving presentations Writing an essay – seven stages • Analysis of the question or title – the content must address this • Research the topic: start with wiki, but end with 1o/2o sources. • Decide the structure of the essay (order of content) • Draft • Review & edit • Proof read and double-check citations and references • Reflect on the feedback to improve your next assignment Prepare Write Review Finish Using named examples, compare and contrast the impacts of ocean acidification on plankton and coral EffectKey words Instruction Subjects – equally weighted! • Title • Introduction (<100 words) – aim of the essay (1 paragraph) • Body (800 words) • Part 1 (200 words) – What are coral and plankton and what is ocean acidification • Part 2 (200 words) – How does acidification affect plankton (named examples) • Part 3 (200 words) - How does acidification affect coral (named examples) • Part 4 (200 words) – Differences and similarities between the effects • 3. Conclusion (<100 words) – mirrors the introduction (1 paragraph) • References Clarity and Technicality • Write clearly • Be concise and to the point • Use as simple language as possible (e.g. use not utilise) • Use words (incl. technical terms) correctly and precisely*. • Include Figures, Tables and/or equations (e.g. Figure 1)**. • Make sure they are numbered, have captions and are cited in the text. • Spell check and Grammar check. *e.g. never use ‘significant’ unless specifically referring to the results of a statistical test. ** Never include ‘Pictures’ or ‘Graphs’. Figure 1. An oak tree. Solitary trees often exhibit bilateral symmetry. Image courtesy of Travelpix Ltd Scientific Style • Avoid personal pronouns (“I”, “We”…) • Be formal (e.g. could not rather than couldn’t) • Break up long sentences • Avoid direct quotations • Consider the length of paragraphs • Use specific examples • Look for relationships between facts (Interpret!) • Use transition words (Therefore, However, Nevertheless, Consequently, Thus, In contrast) • Latin binomials should be formatted correctly (e.g. Bacillus subtilis, Myxococcus llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogochensis) Figure 1.

If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants Isaac Newton Referencing • We need to declare which shoulders we stand on • Allows readers to verify our statements • Acknowledges who made which contribution. • Kudos – Einstein, Newton, Watson and Crick • Intellectual property (IP) • Some knowledge is ‘owned’ • Cannot profit from someone else’s discovery without their consent • Protected by Patents • A researcher invents a new antibiotic • A drug company wants to turn it into a treatment for cancer • That would require the company to invest >1 billion dollars Patents • A researcher invents a new antibiotic • A drug company wants to turn it into a treatment for cancer • That would require the company to invest >1 billion dollars • The researcher and company apply for a patent • The patent protects the ‘IP’ for a number of years • The patent owners have time to develop the treatment and market it • At a later point, competing companies can market their own treatment Patents • A researcher invents a new antibiotic • A drug company wants to turn it into a treatment for cancer • That would require the company to invest >1 billion dollars • The researcher and company apply for a patent • The patent protects the ‘IP’ for a number of years • The patent owners have time to develop the treatment and market it • At a later point, competing companies can market their own treatment Patents • Without patents, IP can be stolen • Removes the incentive for drug companies to invest in new drugs • Huge penalties for stealing IP • IP is sacrosanct • Scientists will avoid stealing IP at all costs • Extends to other people’s ideas • Referencing is key to avoiding accusations of stealing IP (plagiarism) Intellectual Property Written assignments MUST be in your own words. Do NOT take short cuts by copying even the smallest amount of material from anywhere (including the internet, books or another student’s text). This is plagiarism and will be detected. N.B. Presenting work generated by AI as if it were your own is Unacceptable Academic Practice and you must not do this. AU procedures and penalties for 'Unacceptable Academic Practice' are strict and some may prevent you from qualifying for your degree see:https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/academic- registry/handbook/regulations/uap/ Plagiarism • Usually either: 1. Text from internet is copy/pasted into assignment. 2. Student A lends text to help Student B with assignment → Student B copy/pastes A’s text into their own assignment. Plagiarism (Unacceptable Academic Practice) ‘Turnitin’ measures plagiarism  Golden Rule: re-word all information you have found to avoid penalties AU penalties for plagiarism  Standard points system → non-negotiable!  By Part II of degree (2nd & 3rd years) all penalties mean zero marks • Penalties are not influenced by ‘intent’ – you can’t say ‘I uploaded a draft by mistake’ • If one student copies another student’s text, both are penalised • Turnitin encompasses student texts at other universities and in past years • Citation and Referencing are our main tools for avoiding plagiarism • All but the most self-evident facts and ideas should be supported by referencing! Plagiarism (Unacceptable Academic Practice)Referencing • According to “house styles” of different universities or academic journals • EVERY style exhibits internal consistency • Each style is a set of rules • A short entry in the appropriate place in text (the citation) • A comprehensive entry (the reference) in the reference list / bibliography (at the end, with all key details) Citations • Placeholders for cross-referencing the reference list. • Every citation must have a corresponding reference in the list (and vice-versa). • Whitworth (2023), found that … [One author] • Darth and Maul (2022), demonstrated that … [Two authors] • Dooku et al. (2019), showed that … [More than two*] • …replacing Asp57 of CheY (Palpatine, 2016). • …evolving later than fish (Whitworth et al., 2017). • …as previously proposed (Solo, 1983; Skywalker, 2015). Can be ‘in text’ or at end of sentences. *et al. stands for ‘et alia’ meaning ‘and others’. Reference List (not a bibliography) • Always include: • Authors (surname, initials) • Year • Journal name (or book title, with publisher) • Page numbers or article number • Ordered alphabetically, by surname of first author • Formatting absolutely consistent • Citation managers – Endnote, Mendeley, … Examples: Journal Article: Reimers, E., & Eftestøl, S. (2012). Response behaviors of Svalbard reindeer towards humans and humans disguised as polar bears on Edgeøya. Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research, 44, 483-489. Meyer-Rochow, V. B., & Gal, J. (2003). Pressures produced when penguins pooh—calculations on avian defaecation. Polar Biology, 27, 56-58. Entire book: Dawkins, R. (1989). The selfish gene 1976 revised edition.

Consider the “cite” function within Google Scholar: Generative AI • Artificial Intelligence can help you in your studies • https://libguides.aber.ac.uk/artificial-intelligence• Work generated by AI cannot be submitted as your own work. • Suspicion of AI mis-use can result in an oral examination. • Panel of 3 staff interview student to determine authenticity of submission. • DLS Sem 2 , 2023: 5 cases – university panel penalised all with a zero mark • No resit allowed - can result in degree failure (40 credit module) • DLS students failed their degree for one use of AI last year. AI-Plagiarism ‘Hallucinated’ references Alkaissi H, McFarlane SI (Feb 19, 2023) Artificial Hallucinations in ChatGPT: Implications in Scientific Writing. Cureus 15(2): e35179. DOI 10.7759/cureus.35179 • AI makes things up. • Imagine a chatty friend who knows nothing, but bullsh*ts authoritatively. • In cases of UAP, ‘hallucinated’ references or facts can count as ‘Fabrication of data’ • It has other failings too. e.g. highly repetitive ‘Points Based System’ 100+220+180 = 500 100+160+180 = 440 100+220+180 = 500 100+160+180 = 440 Penalties based on points totalKey messages • Use AI to inspire your own writing • Do NOT use AI to generate content for your assignments • Find and cite your own references • Present references consistently","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":""}
