Inner Membrane Inter Membrane Space Mitochondrial matrix Complex I Complex II Complex III Complex IV Complex V Cytochrome c NADH NAD+ e - e- FADH2 FAD e - e - REQUIRES OXYGEN NADH • If there is no O2 then there will be no ETC, so NAD+ will never be regenerated and glycolysis could stop. • In order to keep glycolysis going we have to regenerate NAD+ by oxidising NADH • Fermentation to ethanol (alcohol) or lactic acid (lactate) regenerates NAD+ • Some bacteria and yeast use Ethanol fermentation • Certain cells, including human and animal cells use Lactic Acid fermentation Fermentation Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (3C) 1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate (3C) NAD + NADH Pi Complex I Complex II Complex III Complex IV Complex V Cytochrome c NADH NAD + e - e - e - e - REQUIRES OXYGEN NADH • Ethanol fermentation • Lactic Acid fermentation Exploitation of Fermentation Pyruvate (3C) Ethanol (2C) NAD + NADH - Decarboxylation reaction - Reaction to regenerate NAD+ Acetaldehyde (2C) CO2 Enzymes: Pyruvate decarboxylase Alcohol dehydrogenase • Happens twice per glucose. 1 Glu + 2 ADP + 2 Pi => 2 Ethanol + 2 ATP + 2 CO2 Ethanol FermentationLactate Fermentation • Happens twice per glucose. 1 Glu + 2 ADP + 2 Pi => 2 Lactate + 2 ATP Pyruvate (3C) Lactate (3C) - Dehydrogenation reaction - Hydrogen ions released causing cell pH to drop. NAD+ NADH Lactic Acid (3C) Enzymes: Lactate dehydrogenase H+ • Whether pyruvate is converted to ethanol or lactate, NAD+ is produced • NAD + allows glycolysis to continue. • But fermentation only yields 2 ATP per glucose. • Therefore organisms preferentially use aerobic respiration when they can. • Lactate in animals is converted back into glucose by the liver. Fermentation CORI Cycle Lactate Lactate GlucoseGlucose • In the presence of oxygen, 1 glucose makes 30 ATP • Without oxygen, 1 glucose makes 2 ATP by fermentation • If the energy needs of the cell are the same: • The rate of glucose consumption increases 15x in the absence of O2 • Oxygen inhibits ethanol fermentation in yeast • Pasteur effect • Oxygen inhibits glycolysis and suppresses lactate production Glucose consumptionMetabolic control • If all the cell’s AXP is ATP, there is no ADP. • ADP is a substrate of glycolysis, just like NAD+ is. • It also a substrate for oxidative phosphorylation • If respiration has been very active, there is no ADP (it’s all ATP) • ATP synthase, the ETC and glycolysis all slow down. • Addition of more ADP stimulates respiration • Can also be stimulated by ‘work’ - regenerating ADP by ATP hydrolysis • Separate level of control from the allosteric stimulation of enzymes by ADP. Key messages • Anaerobic fermentation allows the continuation of glycolysis by producing additional NAD+ in the absence of O2 • Fermentation is relatively inefficient and can acidify cells. • The Cori cycle segregates lactate production and regeneration of glucose in different organs. • The rate of glycolysis is regulated by metabolic control (inc Pasteur effect) Further reading • Morris et al.
