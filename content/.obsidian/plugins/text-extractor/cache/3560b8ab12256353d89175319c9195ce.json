Concept of the codon BR17520 Cell BiologyLearning outcomes: Understand: • Basic structure of amino acids and how they bond. • That proteins are polymers of amino acids. • Order of aa determines the function of the protein. • Sequence of nucleotides in mRNA specifies order of amino acids in proteins (translation). Campbell et al. Chapt 17 (pages 385- 414) & Chapt 5 (123- 131) Morris et al. Chapter 4 (pages 69 -88) Proteins 1 Structure and function of amino acids Different types of proteins Enzymes: catalyze biochemical reactions eg. amylase, pepsin, nuclease Hormonal Proteins: eg. insulin, oxytocin Structural Proteins: eg. In cell membranes. Keratins in hair, horns etc. Collagens and elastin in skin & tendons Contractile proteins: that aid movement. Eg. actin and myosin in muscles. Transport Proteins eg Haemoglobin carries oxygen in the blood, the cytoskeleton facilitates intracellular movement. Storage Proteins: eg. ovalbumin in bird egg whites, globulins/gliadins in seed endosperm Proteins are key to all cellular processes Translation DNA RNA Protein Transcription Information flow Central dogma /concept of molecular biology These processes are regulated so the correct proteins are present in the correct cells at the correct amounts Transcriptional Regulation Post-transcriptional Regulation Post-translational Regulation α helix β sheet The primary structure is the sequence of amino acids. The secondary structure results from interactions of nearby amino acids. The tertiary structure is the three- dimensional shape of a polypeptide. The quaternary structure results from interactions of polypeptide subunits. Protein Structure Hydro phobic Hydro philic Amino acids – the building blocks of proteins • α-amino acids • Central C atom (α-carbon) • Amino group (NH2) • Carboxylic acid group (COOH) • Hydrogen atom (H) • Specific side chain (R) Amino group α carbon Carboxyl group NH2 COOH R C H Variable (residual) group specific to each amino acid Common to all amino acids 20 amino acids 20 different side chains It is the variable R group that gives each amino acid its: • Size • Shape • Charge • H-bonding capacity • Hydrophobic character • Chemical reactivity Amino group α carbon Carboxyl group NH2 COOH R C H Amino acids The R-group is specific to different amino acids Most simple is Glycine where the R- group is a Hydrogen atom R-group The R-group gives each aa its unique chemistry Amino acids can be divided into groups depending on the specific chemical properties possessed by their side chain Here into three main groups • Hydrophobic • Hydrophilic • Specials HYDROPHOBIC AMINO ACIDS Alanine (Ala, A) Valine (Val, V) Leucine (Leu, L) Isoleucine (Ile, I) Methionine (Met, M) Phenylalanine (Phe, F) Tryptophan (Trp, W) Tyrosine (Tyr, Y) Hydrophobic amino acids are those with non-polar and uncharged R-groups. Cannot form hydrogen bonds so do not interact with water. Found at the core of protein tertiary / quaternary structure (hidden from water) HYDROPHILIC AMINO ACIDS Polar Acidic Basic Lysine (Lys, K) Arginine (Arg, R) Histidine (His, H) Aspartic acid (Asp, D) Glutamic acid (Glu, E) Asparagine (Asn, N) Glutamine (Gln, Q) Serine (Ser, S) Threonine (Thr, T) Asymmetrically arranged covalent bonds R-groups that gain a proton (H+) at cellular pH to become positively charged R-groups that lose a proton (H+) at cellular pH to become negatively charged Hydrophilic amino acids are charged or polar so they easily form hydrogen bonds /dissolve / react with water. Found at the surface of protein tertiary / quaternary structure (attracted to water) SPECIAL AMINO ACIDS Glycine (Gly, G) Proline (Pro, P) Cysteine (Cys, C) + Selenocysteine Glycine is small and can more freely rotate, Increases flexibility of protein, facilitates folding Proline only AA where the R group linked back to N. Very stable, Restricts rotation Cysteine terminal sulphur SH bonds are very strong together can form disulphide bond Amino Acids to Proteins • peptide bond • joins two amino acids • amino group of one aa bonds with the carboxyl group of another aa Individual amino acids are joined by peptide bonds to form a polypeptide. The alpha carbon and other core parts of the aa form the main chain and each R-group for a side chain Amino group α carbon Carboxyl group NH2 COOHC H NH2 COOH R C H NH2 C R C H R CN H O H COOH Amino end Carboxyl end Peptide bond H2O R Amino acid Amino acid Peptide A polypeptide has a ‘carboxyl end’ (the C-terminus) and an ‘amino end’ (N terminus) A polypeptide chain has a backbone that consists of a series of amino acids linked by peptide bonds. The linked amino acids have a small amount of room to twist depending on the chemistry of the R groups of the adjacent amino acids. These angles of rotation are called torsion angles and contribute to the secondary structure of the protein. NH2 C R C H R CN H O H COOH Amino end Carboxyl end Peptide bond A polypeptide results from amino acids linking together via peptide bonds. Polypeptides can be represented in various styles that may show more or less detail but all are correct. Eg. Another style of polypeptide diagram is shown below. The core chain is shown in blue and the side chains made up of the variable R-groups are shown in green. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stR6RWIonf4 To remind you how peptide bonds form Watch the video (2 min 20 sec) Interpret the diagrams of polypeptides in this and the next slide: Which end is the N-terminus / C-terminus? How many amino acids are there in this polypeptide? Identify the peptide bonds that link the individual amino acids together Which end is the N-terminus / C-terminus? How many amino acids are there in the polypeptide? Identify the peptide bonds that link the individual amino acids together RNADNA mRNA mRNA Protein Nucleus Cytosol Extracellular fluid Nucleolus tRNADNA Gene Ribosomes Actin protein Growing actin filament Ribosome moves along mRNA in a 5' to 3' direction. mRNA Anticodon Incoming tRNA charged with amino acid tRNA Ribosome Translation Ribosomes translate mRNA in the cytosol, producing polypeptide chains. The resulting proteins carry out vital cellular functions. Transport mRNA travels through nuclear pores into the cytoplasm. Growing polypeptide chain Transcription During transcription, RNA polymerase reads a DNA sequence and produces a complementary, antiparallel strand of RNA. RNA processing In eukaryotes, the primary RNA transcript is modified in the nucleus, creating mature mRNA and noncoding RNA. RNA polymerase Primary transcript (RNA) 5' cap Spliceosome Exon Intron Intron lariat Polymerase movement Promoter region RNA transcript RNA-DNA duplex Template DNA Terminator sequence 3' E site A site P Already covered how: Immature RNA transcript is copied from DNA template Processed in the nucleus to form a mature mRNA Passes out of nucleus and in turn forms a template for the nucleic acid code to be translated into protein Although the DNA / RNA code appears to be a continuous string of nucleotides. It is actually read in groups of three (codons). Each codon represents one of the 20 amino acids. Not always obvious what the intended ‘reading frame’ is. Concept of the ‘reading frame’ Reading the message in DNA ZWTHEBIGBOYSAWTHEBADMANRUN ZWTHEBIGBOYSAWTHEBADMANRUN ZWTHEBIGBOYSAWTHEBADMANRUN 26 letter message, 8x3 triplets + 2 letters Reading the message. DNA & RNA are designed to be read in pre-prescribed codons. Relies on the start of translation being in the correct place. If translation starts in the wrong place it can result in a ‘nonsense’ protein or a truncated protein. Correct protein Nonsense protein Most AA can be represented by more than one codon. How many possible codons are there? 43 or 4 X 4 X 4 = 64 But there are only 20 amino acids so many are represented by more than one codon Each RNA codon = 1 aa Eg UUU = phenylalanine Does it matter exactly where translation starts?UCU= Serine CUC= leucine UCUCUC= alternating S /L Does it matter exactly where translation starts?UCA also = Serine Does it matter exactly where translation starts? DNA Transcription Translation Codon mRNA Amino acid Charged tRNA Codon–anticodon pairing Note that the first base in the codon (5' end) pairs with the last base (3' end) in the anticodon.
