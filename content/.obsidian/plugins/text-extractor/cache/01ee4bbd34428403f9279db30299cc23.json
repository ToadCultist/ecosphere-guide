Stage 4 – Oxidative phosphorylation – electron carriers donate electrons to the ETC. Produces: ATP Fatty acids are major components of fats They are broken down to form acetyl CoA and electron carriers. Acetyl CoA enters the TCA cycle/ETC to produce ATP The fatty acid breakdown pathway is called beta-oxidation Glycerol Fatty Acid Fatty Acid Fatty Acid Beta-oxidation C C C C CC C H H H H H H HHHHHH O OH Carboxyl groupα Carbonβ Carbon Fatty acids typically have an even number of carbon atoms. Most have 18-22 carbons, but can have as few as 4, and as many as 28. Bond broken between a and b carbons (b-oxidation). Each cycle of b-oxidation removes a 2C unit, which is oxidised to reduce electron carriers. O S-CoA C R 1. Dehydrogenation reaction: (transfer of hydrogen atoms to FAD). 2. Hydration reaction: Addition of hydroxyl group to β carbon and hydrogen atom to α carbon. 3. Dehydrogenation reaction: Hydrogen removed from β carbon and accepted by NAD 4.
