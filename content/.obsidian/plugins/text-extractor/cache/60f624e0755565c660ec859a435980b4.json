{"path":"University/University slides/Ecology and Conservation/Competition.pdf","text":"CompetitionObjectives By the end of this lecture, you should understand: • ‘Competition’ as a form of species interaction • Definitions of ‘intraspecific’ and ‘interspecific competition’ • Experimental methods used to determine the effects of competition • An understanding of some of the mechanisms species use to reduce levels of interspecific competition Species may interact in a number of ways: • Competition (-1, -1) • Predation (-1, +1) • Parasitism (-1, +1) • Mutualism (+1, +1) • Commensalism (0, +1) • Neutralism (0,0) Species interactionsCompetition “Occurs when a number of organisms of the same or different species utilise common resources that are in short supply” (Krebs, 1978) CompetitionIntraspecific competition www.mycorrhiza.org Interspecific competition Effect of varying the proportion of each of two species is explored while keeping overall density constant For example, at an overall density of 200 plants: • 100 species A, 100 species B • 150 species A, 50 species B • 0 species A, 200 species B, etc. Replacement series Reduces the fecundity of these two species of wild oats Intraspecific competition Factors that control the distribution of two species of barnacles in an intertidal gradient TIDES Mean High Spring Mean High Neap Mean Mean Low Neap Mean Low Spring BIOLOGICAL (competition, predation) PHYSICAL (desiccation) DISTRIBUTION LarvaeAdults Balanus Chthamalus Chthamalus Balanus Intraspecific competition Competition between Paramecium species Competitive Exclusion Principle “The instance where two species which make their livings in identical ways are unable to exist in a stable fashion.” (May, 1981) (a) Asterionella formosa, when grown alone in a culture flask, establishes a stable population (b) When Synedra ulna is grown alone it does the same (c) When grown together, in Synedra drives Asterionella to extinction Competition between diatoms Root and shoot competition between subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum) and skeleton weed (Chondrilla juncea). Experimental designs used to study below and aboveground dry weights. Interspecific competition in plants “The principle that two species are more different where they occur together than when they are separated geographically.” Character displacement Controversial Ecology Mud snail feeding Character displacement www.geo.arizona.edu Niche Partitioning Avoiding competition “The influence of plants upon each other, caused by products of metabolism.” Allelopathy Controversial Ecology Greenhouse experiment to demonstrate the detrimental effects of grass on apple tree seedlings Allelopathy • Most widely distributed vascular plant in the world • One of the most ancient plants on Earth • Covers over 370,000 hectares in UK • Detrimental to agriculture, but some argue beneficial to biodiversity • Eaten by some human cultures but carcinogenic Allelopathy - bracken Pteridium aquilinum Produces phytotoxins that accumulate in the soil and kill germinating seeds Allelopathy - bracken • Introduced in mid-1700s as garden shrub • Allelopathic and highly invasive, very difficult to control • Favours acidic soils of Wales & Scotland Rhododendron ponticumSummary • ‘Intraspecific competition: competition between individuals of same species • Interspecific competition: competition between individuals of different species • Manipulating species density and relative abundance allows detailed study of interspecific interactions • Similar species may reduce interspecific competition by: 1. ‘Character displacement’ 2. ‘Niche partitioning’ • Some plants reduce local competition by ‘allelopathy’ References and acknowledgements: • Kruuk, H.
