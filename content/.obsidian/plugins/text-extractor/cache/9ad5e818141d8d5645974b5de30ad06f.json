BR17120 Genetics, Evolution and Diversity Dr Dylan Phillips (dwp@aber.ac.uk) Why do we use the fruit fly? Drosophila melanogaster • Short life cycle of about 10 days • Easy to culture and to handle • Easy to cross and produces large numbers of offspring • Many mutant types are available • TH Morgan used it to make the first linkage maps • It is a model for development and evolution Griffiths et al. (2005) Linkage mapping • Linkage mapping relies upon recombination of genes during meiosis • Recombination is the process by which new combinations of parental characters arise in progeny • Recombination is affected by independent segregation and crossing over Which genes shall we map? • Eye colour: red (+) and white (w) • Wing length: normal (+) and miniature (m) • Sex-linked (on X chromosome) • Mutant alleles are recessive (only expressed in homozygous or hemizygous conditions) How do we make a map? Need a population of flies in which our genes are segregating X Non-rec, parental Rec, non- parental How do we make a map? Need a population of flies in which our genes are segregating X Non-rec, parental Rec, non- parental Recombination occurs between w & m in F1 female No recombination in male flies How do we make a map? Need a population of flies in which our genes are segregating X Non-rec, parental Rec, non- parental How do we make a map? Then score the relative numbers of phenotypes in the F2 generation How do we make a map? • The proportion of recombinant phenotypes is directly related to the frequency of recombination between w and m during meiosis in the F1 females • The frequency of crossing over between w and m is dependent upon the physical distance between the two genes • The map distance between w and m can be estimated simply by scoring the proportion of recombinants in the F2 progeny What are we going to do? • You will work in pairs • Put funnel in bottle • Knock the F2 flies to the bottom of the tube with a gentle tap on the bench, remove bung and quickly invert tube into funnel • Tap bottle and allow flies to fall into bottle • Bend the paper strip in the middle and pipette 40µl FlyNap on one end • Tap bottle again, remove funnel, add the strip and close lid tightly • Wait for about 4 min until the last fly is asleep Scoring F2 flies • Tip flies onto filter paper under a dissecting microscope • Keep strip with FlyNap in the bottle, and relace bung! • Move flies around using a paint brush • Note the differences between males and females Sex comb Black tip Rounded Smaller Larger Striped tip Pointed Scoring F2 flies • One student classifies each fly with respect to the 2 characters • The other keeps a tally count of the actual numbers of the 4 different phenotypes • Score half the flies and swap • Empty flies into a morgue once you’ve finished scoring • Upload data to online form at the end of practical After Russell (2006) w m + + w + + m • Put funnel in bottle • Knock the F2 flies to the bottom of the tube with a gentle tap on the bench, remove bung and quickly invert tube into funnel • Tap bottle and allow flies to fall into bottle • Bend the paper strip in the middle and pipette 40µl FlyNap on one end • Tap bottle again, remove funnel, add the strip and close lid tightly • Wait ≈4 min until the last fly is asleep • Score the numbers of: w m + + w + + m Environmental effects on gene expression • The mutant allele cu causes the wings of the fruit fly to curl • Identified by T.H. Morgan in 1915 • This practical will test whether or not the expression of this gene is modulated by environmental conditions How was the experiment set up?What are you going to do? • Tubes containing flies grown under the three different temperature regimes –20°C, 24°C, & 28°C • For each temperature we will classify each fly as straight winged, semi-curled or curled Straight Semi-curled Curled Analysis of gene expression • It is not easy to see trends in the data • We have 2 ways of quantifying gene expression: •Penetrance - The proportion of genotypes (cu/cu) that show the expected phenotype (curled wing) •Expressivity - The degree to which a particular genotype (cu/cu) is expressed in the phenotype • We’ll run through the calculation during the Teams seminar Scoring Flies • Once anaesthetised, tip flies onto the filter paper and carefully place under stereo microscope. Keep strip with FlyNap in the bottle and relace bung! • One student classifies each fly with respect to the wing phenotype • Use paintbrush to manipulate the flies • The other keeps a tally count of the actual numbers of the 3 different phenotypes • Empty flies into a morgue once you’ve finished scoring • Repeat for next temperature Straight Semi-curled Curled What are we going to do? • Put funnel in bottle • Knock the flies to the bottom of the tube with a gentle tap on the bench, remove bung and quickly invert tube into funnel • Tap bottle and allow flies to fall into bottle • Bend the paper strip in the middle and pipette 40µl FlyNap on one end • Tap bottle again, remove funnel, add the strip and close lid tightly, wait for about 4 min until the last fly is asleep • Classify each fly with respect to the wing phenotype Straight Semi-curled Curled Data collection… • Make sure you upload your data BEFORE you leave the room • Online form can be accessed via the QR code or link to form email • Teams seminar on Thursday 26th @ 14:10 • Recombination, penetrance & expressivity calculations using class data (it will be recorded)","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
