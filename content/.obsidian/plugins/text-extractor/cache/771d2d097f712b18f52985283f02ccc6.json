They comprise: • Adrenal medulla. Containing chromaffin cells and secreting catecholamines • Adrenal cortex. Containing steroidogenic cells and secreting mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids and weak androgens In non-mammals the two tissue types are not segregated. ANS & Adrenal medulla ACh ACh ACh NA Chromaffin cells are modified postganglionic neurons The adrenal medulla is a modified ganglion of the sympathetic autonomic nervous system Secrete adrenaline and noradrenaline (epinephrine and norepinephrine) into circulation Effects of adrenaline and noradrenaline α and β adrenergic receptor types, with multiple subtypes. α receptors have greater sensitivity for noradrenaline than adrenaline; β2 receptors have greater affinity for adrenaline; β1 receptors bind adrenaline and noradrenaline equally. α1 receptors (in most targets) cause excitatory response, e.g. contraction of smooth muscle in blood vessel walls; α2 receptors cause inhibitory response, e.g. inhibition of smooth muscle in GI tract; β1 receptors (mainly in heart) are excitatory, e.g. increased rate and force of contraction of heart; β2 receptors generally inhibitory, e.g. = bronchiolar dilation. Adrenal cortex Mineralocorticoids Mainly aldosterone. Regulates homeostasis of Na+ and K+, helps increase/maintain blood pressure and volume. Sex hormones Androgens and estrogens, but no masculinising/feminising effects due to relatively low importance versus gonads. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA; weak androgen). Unimportant in males, but is important in female libido and hair growth. Glucocorticoids Mainly cortisol and corticosterone Regulate metabolism: stimulate gluconeogenesis, inhibit glucose uptake by many tissues (not brain), stimulate protein degradation, facilitate lipolysis Anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects at pharmacological levels. Adrenal cortex control Adrenal cortex isn’t directly controlled by neurons of the ANS, but IS controlled by the brain Corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) Controls cortex of adrenal gland Endocrine system (3) • The adrenal glands • The generalised stress response • Octopamine in insects The stress response Any disturbance to the body is a stressor A variety of different stressors elicit a characteristic sequence of responses in the body, across vertebrates = general adaptation syndrome The stress response is controlled by the hypothalamus of the brain It has three distinct stages: 1. Fight-or-flight response 2. Resistance reaction 3. Exhaustion An initial, fast response to help the body run away from a threat of fight it off Hypothalamus activates sympathetic autonomic nervous system Includes direct innervation of organs, and activation of the adrenal medulla Phase 1: Fight-or-flight responseReminder: autonomic tone Organ (selected examples only) Sympathetic stimulation Parasympathetic stimulation Heart Increased rate, increased force Decreased rate, decreased force Blood vessels Constriction Dilation (vessels supplying penis/clitoris) Lungs Dilation of bronchioles Constriction of bronchioles Eye Dilation of pupil Constriction of pupil Adrenal medulla Stimulation None Digestive tract Decreased motility, contraction of sphincters, inhibition of digestive secretions Increased motility, relaxation of sphincters, stimulation of digestive secretions Urinary bladder Relaxation Contraction (emptying) Mobilises resources for immediate activity Inhibits non-essential body functions Allows maximum physical and mental exertion Phase 1: Fight-or-flight response If the fight or flight response wasn’t successful, the resistance reaction begins The aim of the resistance reaction is to mobilise resources and convert them into energy for a continued response to the stressor It is triggered more slowly, but is much longer lasting than the fight-or- flight reaction Phase 2: Resistance reaction The resistance reaction is still controlled by the hypothalamus Phase 2: Resistance reaction Adrenal cortex isn’t directly controlled by neurons of the ANS, but IS controlled by the brain Corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) Controls cortex of adrenal gland Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) causes adrenal cortex to secrete cortisol -Breaks down lipids -Stimulates glucose production -Breaks down proteins ACTH also suppresses GH, TSH, and gonadotropins, suppressing growth, metabolism, and reproduction ACTH storage vesicles in anterior pituitary also contain β- endorphin; may exert analgesic effect Phase 2: Resistance reaction 3.5 day crawl down a glacier with a badly broken leg whilst suffering from hypothermia and dehydration! The resistance reaction will end once the body’s reserves have run out Prolonged high cortisol levels result in muscle wasting and immune suppression Implications for captive animal welfare Phase 3: ExhaustionEndocrine system (3) • The adrenal glands • The generalised stress response • Octopamine in insects Octopamine: the insect analogue of adrenaline • A biogenic amine • Can act as a neurotransmitter, e.g. in firefly lanterns • Can also act as a neuromodulator… Octopamine dishabituates locust visual neurons Bacon et al.
