Approaches to Influence government and the private sector • Build relationships • Develop relationships with conservation-minded officials, bureaucrats and private sector employees • Provide expert advice • Ideas and analysis regarding threats and possible solutions • Create standards • Allows compliance with laws and commitments to be measured and evaluated • Frame Issues • Shape how people think about conservation issues • Promote public and media interest in solutions and actions • Take direct action • Acquire and manage land • Breed captive populations of endangered species Discussion • Think of a specific conservation activity • How have conservationists used each of the following approaches to influence people? • Relationship building • Expert advice • Creating standards • Framing issues • Direct action Advocacy • Being invited to important decision-making forums • Being listened to and respected • Sustaining long-term access to those in power Campaigning • Increasing cost of inaction • For governments • Negative media stories • Difficult questions from opposition politicians • For corporations • Consumer boycotts • Loss of licenses • Loss of employees • Loss of brand value Framing • Align with issues that are important and meaningful to people • Cultural and national identity • Health and wellbeing • Self-realisation • Adventure • Compassion and concern for others • Examples • Greenpeace – save the whale (1970) • David and Goliath • Cold War • People power • Climate change • Polar bear Biophilia E. O. Wilson • Humans have innate affiliation with the natural world and living systems • Industries want to be associated positively with the natural world • News, entertainment and education media • Tourism and cultural activities Regulatory frameworks • Conservation policy • Framed by scientists, policy experts, senior bureaucrats, advisors • Meet at large international events and in small working groups • Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP) • Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) • EU Common Agricultural Policy • Conservation organisations • Join these communities and events • Push for systematic, ordered and authoritative implementation of conservation policy • E.g. by influencing international conventions which must then be translated into national laws E.g. CITES (1973) • Regulates trade in endangered species • Trade in wildlife should not endanger wild populations • IUCN • Prepared and circulated draft to 90 governments and international organisations • US Government • Unimpressed with first draft • Audubon Society (conservation charity) • Worked with United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) • Produced a new draft to satisfy US Government • Formed the basis for discussions at international conference • Resulted in international treaty, signed by 173 countries • Since then, only one species has gone extinct due to wildlife trade (Spix’s Macaw) E.g. European Birds Directive (1979) • International Council for Bird Preservation (ICBP) • Worked with European Commission to develop Birds Directive • Imposed controls on hunting, killing and trading wild birds • Required EC countries to designate Special Protection Areas (SPAs) for protection of rare and endangered species • Make major contribution to Europe’s network of protected areas (Natura 2000) • World’s largest network of protected areas (18% / 6% of EU terrestrial / marine territory) Categorisation and assessment schemes • Required for consistent implementation of international treaties and directives • Simplify nature into quantifiable, manageable forms • E.g. CITES Red Data Book • Classifies species into • Extinct (Ex) – not recorded in the wild for 50 years • Endangered (E) – survival unlikely if conditions / factors persist • Vulnerable (V) – taxa likely to become “endangered” if factors persist • Rare (R) – not at present “endangered” or “vulnerable”, but at risk • Indeterminate (I) – one of the above three, but not enough information to say which one! • Indicates how each species should be treated • Allows compliance of each country to be monitored E.g. Birds Directive • European Commission • Asked ICBP to prepare inventory of important bird areas • ICBP • Published the list and site selection criteria as a book • Allowed citizens to hold their governments to account • New EU member states • Required to identify special protected areas (SPAs) for birds as condition of accession • Birdlife European Network • Authority on identification of sites • Worked with conservation organisations in pre-accession countries Practice guidelines • Advise governments how to implement conservation treaties and directives • Must be issued by credible authority • Conservation organisations often play a major role • E.g. CITES Animal Committee • Publishes guidelines on how to determine whether a trade is detrimental to a wild population Capacity-Building • Improves the expertise and skills local conservation groups • Writing manuals • Running training workshops • Working with staff in partner organisations Limitations of regulation • Government may lack authority or will to enforce regulations • Lengthy processes • E.g. it may take years for a newly discovered species to be listed under CITES • Species may have been collected to extinction before regulation comes into effect Example: Yavia cryptocarpa cactus • Discovered in Argentina • British Cactus and Succulent Society • Realised that it could be rapidly collected to extinction • Asked researchers to delay announcement of discovery • Propagated cactus artificially • Offered seeds for sale at same time that announcement of discovery was made Certification • Market-based categorisation schemes • Verifiable standards and criteria • Provide consumers with confidence of sustainability and traceability • Examples • Rainforest Alliance • Marine Stewardship Council • Forest Stewardship Council Example: APRIL • APRIL • Operates huge pulp and paper mill in Sumatra, Indonesia • Used timber of unknown origin (probably rainforest) • Informal network of conservation groups • FoE Finland and UK, indigenous groups, etc. • Targeted wholesalers of APRIL products • Campaigned for boycott • Targeted banks that lent money to APRIL • Several had signed up to principles of ethical investment • WWF • Worked with APRIL to find solutions • Adopt FSC standards • Tighten timber procurement • Set aside block of forest for new national park Homework • Choose a successful conservation campaign • Find out about it • Who ran it? • What were its aims? • Which people/groups/organisations did it target? • Which methods did it use? • What was the key to its success?","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
