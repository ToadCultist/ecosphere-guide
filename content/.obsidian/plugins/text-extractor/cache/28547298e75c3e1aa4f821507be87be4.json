Estimated 4.5 million species ✓Ecdysozoa share remarkably conserved features- insect-like with segments, and jointed limbs, circumoesophageal ring, and terminal mouth. ✓All have a cuticle and undergo ecdysis (moulting). ✓Whether Ecdysozoa is monophyletic is also under discussion! Crustacea Myriapoda Chelicerata Priapulids Nematoda Onychophora Hexapoda PHYLUM: ONYCHOPHORA Onychophorans were common organisms in Cambrian seas (520-540mya) Hallucigenia Aysheaia ✓Segmented ✓Cephalised with CNS, incl. simple ‘brain’ and VNC without segmented ganglia ✓Gas exchange by trachea and spiracles but not same as arthropod trachea. ✓Haemocoel (or mixocoel) ✓Most hermaphoroditic ✓Gonochoristic Characteristics of ONYCHOPHORA Mayer, M. BMC Neurosci 16, 53 (2015). https://doi.org/10.1186/s12868-015-0191-1 Onychophorans are predators. Slime glands, thought to be modified nephridia can shoot an adhesive up to 30 cm to entangle prey. The mouth is equipped with a sharp jaw and ducts from salivary glands (contain enzymes). Note unjointed antennae and serially iterated unjointed legs PHYLUM: ARTHROPODA OVER A MILLION DESCRIBED SPECIES, MAKING UP MORE THAN 80% OF ALL KNOWN LIVING ANIMALS SPECIES ARTHROPODS ✓Massive diversity and they derive from a common ancestor 550Ma or so. ✓Common segmental structure and exoskeleton. ✓Ribosomal evidence also suggests a common pancrustacean ancestor- supported by Mitochondrial genome analysis- sharing of same primitive arrangement. Characteristics of the Phylum ARTHROPODA ✓ Bilateral, triploblastic protostomes ✓ Segmented, body divided into head and trunk regions, with further specialisation- TAGMOSIS, ✓ Carapace often present ✓ Sclerotised exoskeleton, made of chitin, protein, dorsal TERGITES, lateral PLEURITES, ventral STERNITES ✓ Each segment primitively has pair of jointed appendages ✓ Compound eyes, paired ventral ganglionated nerve cords Characteristics of arthropods, continued…. ✓ Coelom reduced (only parts of reproductive and excretory system) ✓ Body cavity is HAEMOCOEL ✓ Circulatory system open. Dorsal heart with OSTIA ✓ Gut complete and highly specialised, chitinous ✓ PERITROPHIC MATRIX surrounds digested material ✓ Functional cilia absent, except in sperm of a few ✓ Growth by ECDYSONE mediated MOULTING (ECDYSIS) ✓ Muscles metamerically arranged ✓ Most dioeceous Phylum Arthropoda • Phylum Arthropoda contains 4 subphyla: ➢ Subphylum Crustacea – crabs, lobsters, shrimps etc. ➢ Class Branchiopoda- fairy shrimps, water fleas etc. ➢ Class Malacostraca – true crabs. ➢ Class Thecostraca – barnacles. ➢ Class Copepoda – copepods. ➢ Class Ostracoda – ostracods…..etc. ➢ Subphylum Hexapoda. ➢ Class Insecta – insects. Phylum Arthropoda • Phylum Arthropoda contains 4 subphyla: ➢ Subphylum Myriapoda. ➢ Class Chilopoda - centipedes. ➢ Class Diplopoda – millipedes….. ➢ Subphylum Chelicerata. ➢ Class Pycnogonida – sea spiders. ➢ Class Euchelicerata ➢ Subclass Merostomata – horse shoe crabs. ➢ Subclass Arachnida – true spiders….etc. INSECTS (HEXAPODS) ARE CRUSTACEANS! ✓Hexapods within Pancrustacea? ✓The monophyly of Crustacea plus Hexapoda came from mitochondria genome arrangement and other analyses- incl. nervous system arrangement. ✓Two main crustacean classes- Malacostraca and Branchiopoda. ✓Not clear whether these are monophyletic and sister group to Hexapoda, or Hexapoda and Branchipoda are sister groups. Telford (2018) suggests that Branchiopoda are close to Hexapoda- i.e. Daphnia are insects!

Most diverse class within phylum with 60,000 to 80,000 extant species in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats. ✓Class Bivalvia are molluscs with hinged two-part shells, include clams, oysters, mussels, and scallops. ✓Class Cephalopoda are molluscs with large heads, large eyes, and grasping tentacles, include octopus, squid, cuttlefish, and nautiloids. ✓Class Polyplacophora consists of chitons, snail-like molluscs with eight- part overlapping scale shell.
