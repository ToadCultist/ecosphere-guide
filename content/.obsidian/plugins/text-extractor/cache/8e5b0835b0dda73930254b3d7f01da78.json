Great Fens project • bought and restored farmland between two fen reserves Landscape and climate • Climate corridors • Connect habitat patches • Enable wildlife to track their ecological niche • E.g. by moving to higher latitude of altitude • Enhancing permeability • Take every opportunity to increase habitat connectivity • E.g. restoring hedgerows or riparian vegetation • Increasing uncertainty (e.g. due to climate change) • Favours functionalist approach • Focus on processes rather than outcomes • Even at site level Captive breeding for reintroduction • Last resort • Where threats to wild populations cannot be reduced sufficiently • Genetic issues • Inbreeding • Genetic drift • Adaptation to captivity • Behavioural issues • Loss of survival skills • Loss of social skills • No successful re-introductions of captive-bred great apes • Can still be effective • E.g. Black-footed ferret, Hawaiian goose, California condor • Last remaining individuals taken into captivity • Progeny released and re-established in the wild Off-site preservation • Where threats within native range cannot be reduced sufficiently • Introduce species to area where it is not native • Can have negative effects on ecosystems in new range • E.g. Himalayan Tahr • Vulnerable to extinction within native range • Introduced to New Zealand • Has had negative impact on native vegetation • Considered pest species there Strict enforcement • Undercover investigation of wildlife crimes • Patrols by armed wardens and wildlife rangers • Surveillance from watchtowers • Common in protected areas in some regions • North America • Africa • India • Can be effective • E.g. African Black Rhino • Disadvantages • Costly • Ineffective where species are wide-ranging • Alienates local communities Market-based approaches • Promote sustainable use of wildlife • E.g. Project Seahorse (Philippines) • Promotes sustainable harvesting of seahorses • For Chinese medicine market • Requirements • Cohesive community • Willing to take risks on new venture • Flexible market • Talented entrepreneurial individuals Managing human-wildlife conflicts • Increased conflict between humans and wildlife • From expansion of towns and villages into wild areas • From expansion of species ranges due to conservation successes • E.g. large carnivores in Europe • From climate change • E.g. polar bears • Situations must be managed • Or local communities will kill wildlife Question • How can you manage human-wildlife conflicts? Managing human-wildlife conflicts • Approaches • Barriers • Deterrents • Compensation schemes • Education • Reserves/corridors • Change agricultural practice Example: Elephants in India • Elephants • Range over large areas • Very large appetites • Can cause enormous damage to crops • Powerful • Can easily kill people • Intelligent • Find ways to overcome obstacles • Compensation • Involves time-consuming bureaucracy • Disliked by farmers • Early warning systems • Allow farmers to mobilise against elephants • Deploy deterrents Species action plans • Produced through consultation with stakeholders • Identify threats and remedial actions • Enable conservation efforts to be coordinated • Enable resources to be allocated effectively • UK Biodiversity action plan • Species action plans • Habitat action plans • Local biodiversity action plans","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
