Electron transport chain • Electrons move between complexes on diffusible carriers • UQ (ubiquinone) carries e- from Complexes I and II to III • Cytochrome c carries e- from Complex III to IV Electrochemical series • Redox couples have different potentials • Electrons move from –ve to +ve potential couples • The ETC is an ordered series of couples. Iron Sulfur Clusters • Positioning of carriers moves electrons spatially, like a molecular wire The proton gradient • The proton gradient is like a battery • Charge is separated across the membrane • Protons want to move back into the matrix (Proton motive force) • A consequence of charge and concentration A A A AAA A A A c1 c2 - +- + - + - + - + - + - + - + - +- + - +- + A A A AAA A A A c1 c2 - +- + - + - + - +- +- +- + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - +- + - +- + - +- +- +- + - +- +- +- + ATP Synthase • Protons move across the membrane • Causes rotation of the F0 ATP synthase rotor • F1 stator catalyses synthesis of ATP ATP Balance Sheet • Glycolysis 2 ATP 2 NADH • Link Reaction 2 NADH • TCA cycle (2x) 2 ATP 6 NADH 2 FADH2 • Oxidative phosphorylation 25 ATP <- 10 NADH 3 ATP <- 2 FADH2 • Total 32 ATP Key messages • The ETC moves electrons from NADH/FADH2 onto oxygen, making water. • This makes the ETC and the TCA dependent on oxygen (aerobic) • As e- pass along the ETC, protons are pumped out of the mitochondrial matrix, creating a proton motive force. • ATP synthase lets the protons back in, coupled with ATP synthesis • About 2.5 ATP are made per NADH and 1.5 ATP per FADH2 • Oxidation of glucose yields around 32 ATP, of which 28 ATP comes from oxidative phosphorylation.
