Bieber, J.]) Borrelia burgdorferi (spirochaete) 1st isolated by Willy Burgdorfer (1982) 0.3µm W, 5-20µm L (Gram –ve; no LPS in outer membrane) 19 Borrelia spp. globally (B. garinii / B. afzelii co-occur in Europe with Bb) Ixodes spp. (I. ricinus in Europe) tick host (egg-larva-nymph-adult) Competent (can infect tick with Bb) vs non-competent (eg. deer) host reservoirs Ticks sit on vegetation and latch onto passing hosts Symptoms initially after 2wks (Erythema migrans -80% of cases), viral-like symptoms, later arthritic/neurological problems Ancient disease (>5000yrs; Ötzi the Iceman was infected with Bb) Strong climatic patterns due to tick behavior Nymphs on smaller hosts, adults on larger (usually) Humans are dead-end (non –competent) host for Bb. (Class III zoonosis- symptoms only in H). Ticks require vertebrate blood Co-infection with Babesia microti (Babesiosis; protozoan) and Anaplasma phagocytophilum (bacterium; Human granulocytic anaplasmosis) common (1- 40%) Ixodes ricinus Borrelia spirochaetes Life cycles (European) of: A) Ixodes ricinus tick B) Borrelia spp. 2-3 yr tick life cycle X (deer) =non-competent host for Borrelia spp. B. garinii -bird vectors (neurological symptoms in H) Higher Plants Terrestrial Simplified Carbon (energy) Cycle [Dominated by microbes] Aquatic Littoral Zones Fungi Bacteria Plankton Ligno- cellulose Dissolved Organic Carbon CO2 CO2 CH2O + O2 CO2 + H2O OVERALL Photosynthesis = Respiration Mainly Microbial Photo- autotrophs Chemo- heterotrophs >50% Microbial (marine) Carbon Cycle (major pools and fluxes) Most terrestrial organic C in soils (2.5x more than in plant biomass) http://www.ipcc.ch/ } Global warming 1600 (Carbonates) Carbon Cycle (major pools) (Limestone) (Coal, Oil) Global Carbon Cycle = Flow of Energy https://twitter.com/RARohde/status/1131224330241806337/video/1 Deep ocean Biosphere Fossil fuels Atmosphere Click on the link above to see effect of human activity on the pools of carbon on the planet over the past 200 years MOR soil Distinct layers -due to absence of earthworms Progressive decomposition of plant litter downwards (with fresh material being added to top) DECOMPOSITION Fungi Bacteria Soil Fauna R1 (1° resource) Plant Litter  R2 (2° resource) e.g. Faeces  R3  R4   Inorganic nutrients MINERALISATION (= CO2 + H2O) Decomposers  Detritus Dead Organic Matter Rate of Decomposition Rainforest Depends on:- Resource Quality (Carbon:Nitrogen ratio) Environmental factors (Temp, Water) Time to 95% decomposition 6mths - 100yrs Tundra Energy Nutrients Measuring Decomposition TIME Litter Dry Wt.
