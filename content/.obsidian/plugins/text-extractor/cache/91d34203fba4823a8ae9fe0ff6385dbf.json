When lactose is the only sugar available in the environment – Cell should switch off transcription of proteins for importing and processing other sugars Requirements of gene regulation • Bacterial cell must be able to • Recognise environmental conditions • In which a gene should be suppressed or activated • Switch transcription on or off • For each individual gene (or group of genes) Genetic switches • Promoter – DNA segment near gene – Binds to RNA polymerase • Initiates transcription of gene • Activators and repressors – Proteins • Bind to DNA near promoter site – Activator • Helps RNA polymerase bind to promoter – Presence allows transcription to begin » Positive regulation – Repressor • Binds to site known as “operator” • May prevent RNA polymerase from binding to promoter • May prevent RNA polymerase from moving along DNA molecule – Absence allows transcription to begin » Negative regulation Example: lactose metabolism • Negative regulation • lacI gene – Codes for lac repressor protein • Binds to lac operator – Prevents binding of RNA transcriptase » Prevents synthesis of enzymes for lactose metabolism Operons • Several genes with related functions – Share a promoter • Transcribed together – Produces a single, multigenic mRNA – Share binding sites for activators or repressors • Regulated as a unit Example: Lac operon • Encodes enzymes for lactose metabolism • 3 structural genes – Z codes for β- Galactosidase – Y codes for Permease – A codes for Transacetylase • Promoter – Binding site for RNA transcriptase • Operator – Binding site for repressor • CAP-binding site – Binding site for activator Allosteric effector • Small molecule • Interacts with activator or repressor – At allosteric site • Changes conformation of protein – Allows it to bind to DNA • Acts as a sensor Example: lactose metabolism – negative regulation • Allolactose – Isomer of lactose • Produced within cells – By modification of lactose – Only produced in the presence of lactose – Binds to lac repressor • At allosteric site – Changes the shape of the repressor protein » Allosteric transition • Repressor protein – No longer binds to operator • Cannot inhibit transcription • Allolactose – Acts as an inducer for the lac operon Example: lactose metabolism – overview of negative regulation • When lactose is absent – Allolactose is not produced • Repressor binds to lac operator – RNA transcriptase cannot bind to lac promoter » Genes for lactose metabolism are not transcribed • When lactose is present – Allolactose binds to repressor protein • Repressor cannot bind to lac operator – RNA transcriptase binds to lac promoter » Genes for lactose metabolism are transcribed • Enzymes for lactose metabolism are only produced when lactose is present Catabolite repression • Bacteria may have choice of compounds – E.g. several different sugars present in the environment • Some compounds are easier to metabolise than others – Require less energy • When two compounds are present – Presence of the preferred compound • Blocks transcription of genes for metabolism of less preferred compound Example: lactose metabolism – positive regulation • Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) – Present at high concentrations in the absence of glucose – Binds to catabolite activator protein (CAP) • At allosteric site – Changes the shape of the activator protein » Allosteric transition • CAP – Binds to activator-binding site of lac operon • Helps RNA transcriptase to bind to the promoter Example: lactose metabolism in the presence of glucose• Glucose – Metabolised more efficiently than lactose • When glucose is absent – Levels of cAMP are high • CAP binds to lac activator-binding site – RNA transcriptase binds to lac promoter » Genes for lactose metabolism are transcribed • When glucose is present – Levels of cAMP are low • CAP cannot bind to lac activator-binding site – RNA transcriptase cannot bind to lac promoter » Genes for lactose metabolism are not transcribed • Enzymes for lactose metabolism are only produced when lactose is present and glucose is absent Temperate phage • Two alternative life cycles • Lytic cycle – Phage particle infects the bacterial cell • Injects genetic material into cyctoplasm – Replicates independently within the cell » Lyses the cell to release new phage particles – Most genes are expressed • Lysogenic cycle – Phage genetic material • Integrated into bacterial chromosome (as prophage) – Replicated when the chromosome replicates – Most genes are not expressed Switching between cycles • When resources are abundant – Bacterial hosts are common • Rate of infection is high – Lytic cycle allows rapid increase in number of phage particles • When resources are scarce – Bacterial hosts are scarce • Rate of infection is low – Lysogenic cycle allows phage to persist until conditions improve Example: Bacteriophage λ • Temperate phage • 50kb DNA genome • Genes expressed in logical sequence • DNA replication • Recombination • Assembly of phage particle • Host cell lysis Example: Bacteriophage λ – negative regulation • When phage infects bacterial cell – It must either enter lytic cycle or lysogenic cycle • Cannot enter both or neither • OR operator – Overlaps two promotors • Initiate transcription in opposite directions • Two repressor proteins – Both bind to the OR operator – λ repressor protein • Encoded by cI gene – Blocks transcription of cro gene – Blocks transcription of lytic genes – Cro protein • Encoded by cro gene – Blocks transcription of cI gene • λ repressor and Cro are in competition – Each blocks production of the other Example: Bacteriophage λ – positive regulation • CII activator protein – Binds to promotor PRE • Allows transcription of cI – Sensitive to bacterial proteases • Active when resources are abundant • Inactive when bacterial cell is starved Example: Bacteriophage λ – overview • When resources are abundant – Bacterial proteases are active • CII activator protein is degraded – λ repressor protein is not transcribed » Lysis genes are transcribed » Phage enters lytic cycle • When resources are scarce – Bacterial proteases are inactive • CII activator protein binds to promotor – λ repressor protein is transcribed » Transcription of lysis genes is repressed » Phage enters lysogenic cycle","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":""}
