Green fluorescent protein (GFP) • From jellyfish • Concentration is proportionate to amount of light emitted • Inserted downstream of regulatory protein binding site – Expressed at same time as target gene Development • Formation of complex organism • From single cell • Gene regulation • In 3-dimensional space • Over time Model organisms • Drosophila melanogaster • insect • Caenorhabditis elegans • Nematode worm • Danio rerio • Fish • Arabidopsis thaliana • plant Homeotic mutants • Mutation of a single gene • Changes identity of serially reiterated body parts • e.g. insect body segments • Both members of a bilateral pair of structures are altered • Alteration is heritable • Drosophila • Bithorax • Halteres resemble hind wings • Antennapedia • Antennae resemble legs Hox genes in Drosophila • Form two gene complexes • Both on 3 rd chromosome • Bithorax complex • 3 Hox genes • Antennapedia • 5 Hox genes • Gene order • Corresponds to order of body segments • Head to tail Hox genes in Drosophila • If all Hox genes are inactivated • All segments have same identity • All limbs are antennae • All wings are forewings Hox proteins • Homeobox – Sequence shared by all Hox genes in Drosophila • Also found in hox genes of other animals – Codes for DNA-binding protein domain • Hox proteins – Sequence-specific DNA- binding proteins • Control gene expression – Within developing segments and appendages Hox genes in mouse • Organised in four gene clusters • Arose by duplication of ancestral cluster • Each contains 9-11 Hox genes • Order of genes • Identical to drosophila • Head to tail • Homeotic mutants • E.g. Hoxa11 and Hoxd11 • Sacral vertebrae transformed to lumbar vertebrae Maternal effect genes • Expressed in mother and provided to egg • E.g. Bicoid • Differentiates anterior from posterior • Mutants lack anterior region Example: Bicoid in Drosophila • Early embryo is syncytium • All nuclei in continuous cytoplasm • Bicoid protein • Translated from maternal mRNA in egg • Highly concentrated at anterior end • Diffuses to posterior • Concentration decreases along diffusion gradient • Very low beyond halfway point • Binds to promoters of other development genes • Only activates transcription of gap genes at anterior of embryo Zygotic genes • Gap genes • Affect formation of continuous blocks of segments • Mutants (e.g. Kruppel) lack segment blocks • Pair rule genes • Affect formation of segment pairs • Mutants lack part of each segment pair • E.g. even-skipped, odd-skipped • Segment polarity genes • Affect patterning within each segment • E.g. gooseberry • Mutants lack gaps between exoskeleton bands • Hox genes • Affect positional identity of each segment Zygotic gene mutants","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":""}
