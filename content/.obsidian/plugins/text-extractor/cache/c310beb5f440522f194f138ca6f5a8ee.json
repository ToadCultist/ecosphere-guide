Connective tissue takes many forms, but often it is mechanically weak with an open structure Cartilage ECM is mechanically strong. Schwann saw a similarity between cartilage and plant cell walls Bone is a form of ECM which is rigid and performs a similar structural role as cell walls. Images:kentsimmons.uwinnipeg.ca; washington.uwc.edu; www.feppd.org  The material that cells secrete around themselves  An intricate network composed of an array of multidomain macromolecules organized in a cell/tissue-specific manner.  Components of the ECM link together to form a structurally stable composite, contributing to the mechanical properties of tissues. BR17520 5 What is the Extracellular Matrix (ECM)? The ECM is most abundant in connective tissues Connective tissue can be:  Tough and flexible like tendons or the dermis of the skin  Hard and dense like bone  Resilient and shock-absorbing like cartilage  Soft and transparent like the jelly that fills the interior of the eye Connective tissue takes many forms, but often it is mechanically weak with an open structure Cartilage ECM is mechanically strong. Schwann saw a similarity between cartilage and plant cell walls Bone is a form of ECM which is rigid and performs a similar structural role as cell walls.

Figure 20–2 Simplified drawing of a cross section through part of the wall of the intestine of a mammal. BR17520 Each tissue is an organized assembly of cells, held together by cell–cell adhesions, extracellular matrix, or both. What is the Extracellular Matrix (ECM)?BR17520 In connective tissues, the ECM is abundant and carries the mechanical load, in other tissues the ECM is sparse and the cells are directly joined to one another and carry the mechanical load themselves 8 Components of the extracellular matrix and their main roles  The ECM is composed of water, proteins and proteoglycans  Each tissue has an ECM with a unique composition and topology Proteoglyca ns Proteins Collage n Elastin Fibrilli n BR17520 9 ECM: Collagen Collagen is a fibrous protein which is the main contributor of mechanical (tensile) strength in connective tissue. Collagen consists of long triple helices arranged in fibrils. Fibrils bundle together to make fibres, cable-like structures which resist stretching Collagen is synthesised by fibroblasts which can also break existing fibres down if the connective tissue needs to be remodelled Mammals have over 40 different collagen genes and collagens constitute 25% of the total protein mass in a mammal Figure 20-9 Collagen fibrils are organized into bundles BR17520 10 ECM: Collagen Collagen is a fibrous protein which is the main contributor of mechanical (tensile) strength in connective tissue. Mammals have over 40 different collagen genes and collagens constitute 25% of the total protein mass in a mammal Figure 20-9 Collagen fibrils are organized into bundles BR17520 DOI: 10.5005/jp-journals-10026-1032 11 ECM: Collagen Figure 20-10 Procollagen precursors are cleaved to form mature collagen outside the cell. Figure 20–11 Incorrect collagen assembly can cause the skin to be hyperextensible. BR17520 12 Components of the extracellular matrix and their main roles  The ECM is composed of water, proteins and proteoglycans  Each tissue has an ECM with a unique composition and topology Proteoglyca ns Proteins Collage n Elastin Fibrilli n BR17520 13 ECM: Elastin and Fibrillin Elastin is a protein which allows ECM to stretch under tension and relax once the tension is released. Elastin is deposited onto fibrillin fibres Images: alexandria.healthlibrary.ca; Becker et al. (2006) The World of the Cell, 6 th ed. Pearson Fibrillin is a glycoprotein essential for the formation of elastic fibers found in connective tissue. Fibrillin is secreted into the extracellular matrix and provides a scaffold for deposition of elastin.

Pearson BR17520 15 Components of the extracellular matrix and their main roles  The ECM is composed of water, proteins and proteoglycans  Each tissue has an ECM with a unique composition and topology Proteoglyca ns Proteins Collage n Elastin Fibrilli n BR17520 16 ECM: Proteoglycans  While collagen provides tensile strength to resist stretching, proteoglycans provide a complementary function: resisting compression.  Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), negatively charged polysaccharide chains made of repeating disaccharide units, are key to this.  GAGs are strongly hydrophilic and tend to adopt highly extended conformations, which occupy a huge volume relative to their mass.  Chains of GAGs are covalently linked to a core protein to form proteoglycans, which are extremely diverse in size, shape and chemistry.  Figure 20–16 Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are built from repeating disaccharide units. Hyaluronan, a relatively simple GAG, is shown here BR17520 17 ECM: Proteoglycans Figure 20–17 Proteoglycans and GAGs can form large aggregates. (A) Electron micrograph of an aggrecan–hyaluronan aggregate from cartilage, spread out on a flat surface. (B) Schematic drawing of the giant aggregate illustrated in (A) BR17520 Like the pectins of plant cell walls, GAGs bind positively charged ions and trap water molecules to form hydrated gels, thereby providing mechanical support to the extracellular matrix. 18 Components of the extracellular matrix and their main roles  The ECM is composed of water, proteins and proteoglycans  Each tissue has an ECM with a unique composition and topology Proteoglyca ns Proteins Collage n Elastin Fibrilli n BR17520 19 Describe the key components of the extracellular matrix and their main roles Discuss the interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix Examine how cells bind to one another The Extracellular Matrix (ECM)BR17520 20 Interaction between ECM and cells Interaction Fibronectin and Laminin Integrins BR17520 21 Interaction between ECM and cells  Transmembrane receptor proteins called integrins enable cells to interact with the collagen in the ECM  Another ECM protein called fibronectin provides a linkage: part of the fibronectin molecule binds to collagen while another part forms an attachment site for integrins Figure 20–14c Fibronectin and transmembrane integrin proteins help attach a cell to the extracellular matrix. BR17520 Integrins Couple the Matrix Outside a Cell to the Cytoskeleton Inside It 22 Interaction between ECM and cells: integrins  Binding to a molecule on one side of the plasma membrane causes the integrin molecule to stretch out into an extended, activated state so that it then can latch onto a different molecule on the opposite site Figure 20–15 An integrin protein switches to an active conformation when it binds to molecules on either side of the plasma membrane. BR17520 23 The Extracellular Matrix (ECM) Figure 20–18 Cells can be packed together in different ways to form an epithelial sheet. Four basic types of epithelia shown. In each case, the cells are sitting on a thin mat of extracellular matrix, the basal lamina (yellow)  There are more than 200 different cell types in the body of a vertebrate. The majority of these are organized into epithelia  Epithelia: multicellular sheets in which adjacent cells are joined tightly together BR17520 24 The Extracellular Matrix (ECM) Figure 20–19 A sheet of epithelial cells has an apical and a basal surface. The basal surface sits on a specialized sheet of extracellular matrix called the basal lamina, while the apical surface is free.  The basal lamina consists of a thin, though sheet of collagen and a protein called laminin.  Laminin provides adhesive sites for integrins in the basal plasma membranes of epithelial cells.  Laminins serve the linking role like that of fibronectin in other connective tissues Figure 20–20 The basal lamina supports a sheet of epithelial cells.

Tight junctions allow epithelial cell sheets to serve as barriers to solute diffusion. These junctions seal neighbouring cells together so that water soluble molecules cannot easily leak between them BR17520 29 Tight seal Tight junctions These junctions seal neighbouring cells together so that water soluble molecules cannot easily leak between them BR17520 https://doi.org/10.1186/s12987-019-0123-z 30 The Extracellular Matrix (ECM) Binding between cells Tight seal Mechanical attachments Chemical communication Tight junctions Gap junctions Adherens junctions Desmosomes Hemidesmosomes BR17520 31 cadherins Figure 20–23 Cadherin proteins mediate mechanical attachment of one cell to another.  Adherens junctions and desmosomes bind one epithelial cell to another, while hemidesmosomes bind epithelial cells to the basal lamina  They have the same principle: proteins span the plasma membrane and are linked to the cytoskeleton. Cytoskeleton is tied into a network that extends from one cell to another. Figure 20–24 Adherens junctions form adhesion belts around epithelial cells in the small intestine.

BR17520 41 Chemical communication: Gap junctions Figure 20–29 Extracellular signals can regulate the permeability of gap junctions. BR17520 Dopamine decreases the permeability of gap junctions 42 The function of the various junctions in animal cells Figure 20–30 Several types of cell junctions are found in epithelia in animals. Whereas tight junctions are peculiar to epithelia, the other types also occur, in modified forms, in various nonepithelial tissues.
