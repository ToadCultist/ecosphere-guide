Testing for genetic equilibrium 1) Calculate allele frequencies in parents • From parental genotypes 2) Calculate allele frequencies in offspring • From offspring genotypes 3) Calculate expected offspring allele frequencies from Hardy- Weinberg equation • Expected offspring allele frequencies=parental allele frequencies 4) Test for significant difference between observed and expected offspring allele frequencies • Use χ2 test or another appropriate statistical test depending on data 5) If there is no significant difference then population may be at genetic equilibrium So what? • If the Hardy-Weinburg principle is violated then your population is not at genetic equilibrium. • i.e. something interesting is happening! • Your population may be: • Undergoing natural selection • Mating non-randomly (with respect to the gene in question) • Losing alleles through random genetic drift (sampling error) • Undergoing net mutation from one allele to another • Undergoing net migration of some genotypes to or from another population Assumption 1 1. No net migration A a A a A a A a Population 1 Population 1 Population 2 Population 2   Example: Grey wolf • Black coat colour • Rare in European populations • Common in American populations • Molecular genetic study • Black allele originated in domestic dog (grey wolf subspecies) • Introduced to America from Asia • By native Americans Assumptions 2. Population is large • No sampling error Example: Pingalap – Island of the colour-blind • Pingalap Atoll • Small, low-lying pacific island • Bottleneck • Typhoon in 1780’s killed all but 30 people • Sampling error • One of the survivors carried a rare allele for achromatopsia (extreme colour blindness) • Genetic drift • 10% of the population is now colourblind (homozygous for achromatopsia allele) • Allele frequency of approximately 0.32 Assumptions 3. Mating is random with respect to allele A Example: Pigeon • Assortative mating • With regard to size • Disassortative mating • With regard to colour Assumptions 4. No Natural Selection Example: Deer mice • Usually have dark coats • Blends with dark soils • Sand Hills, Nebraska • Pale, sandy soils • Most mice have pale coats • Caused by single-gene mutation • About 4,000 years ago • Confers 0.5% survival advantage Assumptions 5. No net mutation Example • Mutations from wild type to albino • occur more frequently than reverse mutations • Albinos are more likely to be killed by predators • Mutation-selection balance","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":""}
