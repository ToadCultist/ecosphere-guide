The test will be made available at 09:00 on Monday 6th of November. It cannot be started once the deadline has passed. Learning Outcomes to be addressed by the coursework: Describe genetic processes at all levels of organisation (e.g. molecular, chromosomal, population) with reference to appropriate structures and concepts. Carry out genetic experiments in the laboratory, using appropriate equipment and techniques, and analyse and interpret the resulting data. Presenting work generated by AI as if it were your own is Unacceptable Academic Practice and you must not do this. AU procedures and penalties for 'Unacceptable Academic Practice' are strict and some may prevent you from qualifying for your degree see: https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/academic- registry/handbook/regulations/uap/ Clarification of coursework brief It is your responsibility to ensure that you understand the requirements of the coursework that has been set.
