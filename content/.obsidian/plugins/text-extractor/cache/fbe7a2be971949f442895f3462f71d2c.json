Overview In today’s practical you will view slides showing sections through sheep, rodent, fish, and amphibian brains, and dissect a sheep’s brain. Your task during the practical is to make notes and drawings that can serve as revision materials for your examination later this semester. 2. Health and safety A risk assessment for this practical has been completed and is available to you on Blackboard. Please familiarise yourself with it before the practical session. Points deserving of special emphasis include: 1. You must wear gloves and eye protection during the dissection, avoid touching your mouth and eyes, and wash your hands thoroughly before leaving the lab (either at the end of the session, or to take a break). As always, there is strictly no eating or drinking in the lab. 2. You must carry out the dissection using the equipment provided and not your own personal dissection kit. Take particular care with the scalpels so as to avoid the risk of accidental injury. 3. The brains have been preserved in a formalin solution before transfer to a safe preservative. They have also been rinsed before provided to you. However, there is likely to be residual formalin, and the specimens can have a strong smell. If you suspect any heightened health risk (e.g. if you are pregnant), consult with teaching staff immediately. If you find the smell difficult during the session, feel free to take a break and get fresh air (after removing lab coat and gloves, and washing hands). If you are concerned at any point, alert a member of the teaching staff. 4. The lab is strictly divided into ‘dry’ and ‘wet’ halves. You may use writing implements during the ‘dry’ half, but will not be able to during the ‘wet’ half. 3. ‘Dry’ lab exercises In this part of the lab you should make notes and drawings that will aid you in completing the online test. 3.1 Comparative anatomy The fundamental structure of the brain is similar in all modern vertebrates, except jawless fishes. However, the development of each region varies greatly across taxonomic groups (see figure 1). You have access to sagitally sectioned rodent, amphibian (frog), and fish (rainbow trout) stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E), which gives the tissue its pink/purple colour. With the help of figure 1, identify the cerebrum, cerebellum, and tectum (midbrain) and note their relative development in the different species. 3.2 Microscopic anatomy of the cerebellar cortex View the sagitally sectioned cerebellar cortex using the sheep’s cerebellum slide, or the sagittal sections of fish or rodent brains from above. Note the arrangement of white matter, and the three cell layers of the cerebellar cortex: the molecular layer, Purkinje cell layer, and granule cell layer. Sketch this organisation, and the anatomy of a Purkinje cell so that you will be able to identify one in future. Fig. 1: Brain organisation in representative vertebrate groups.

Again, this has been stained with H&E. Select and view a region of cortex. Make brief notes and sketches of: The meninges (membranes) on the outer surface The gross arrangement of grey and white matter Within the grey matter of cerebral cortex, pyramidal neurons have a very distinct shape and should be easy to identify in your slide. Locate a pyramidal cell and sketch its shape so that you will be able to identify one in future. The grey matter of cortex consists of six cell layers that can be distinguished based upon the types and densities of neurons within. Try to distinguish these cell layers from your slide (the easiest way is to try and locate pyramidal cells, since they have distinctive shapes), and make notes and drawings to support you in completing the quiz: 1. Molecular layer - consists only a few neurons 2. External granular layer – relatively thin layer consisting of numerous small, densely packed neurons 3. Pyramidal layer or external pyramidal layer - is composed of medium-sized pyramidal neurons 4. Inner granular layer - contains small, irregularly shaped neurons 5. Ganglionic or inner pyramidal layer - includes large pyramidal cells 6. Multiform layer - small polymorphic and fusiform nerve cells 3.3 Sheep’s brain dissection demonstration Teaching staff will now demonstrate the sheep’s brain dissection. During this demonstration, your task is to follow along using your laminated sheep’s brain atlas, and to make notes and drawings that will help you to complete the online test. After this demonstration you will have the opportunity to dissect a brain yourself and observe the key features more closely, but you will not be able to make notes and drawings within that ‘wet’ part of the lab. A. Gross anatomy The brain is covered in a thick protective membrane called the dura mater. If your sheep’s brain has the dura mater intact, take careful note of the structures you can see before removing it (as some structures may get damaged as you remove the dura mater). When you are ready, remove the dura mater using fine scissors and forceps. From an intact brain, you should be able to locate the following. Make notes and drawings that will support you in doing so during the online test. Spinal cord Brain stem Medulla oblongata Pons Midbrain Superior colliculi Pineal gland (Pituitary gland) Cerebellum Olfactory bulbs Optic chiasm Cerebral cortex Medial longitudinal fissure Left and right hemispheres Sulci (sing. Sulcus) Gyri (sing. Gyrus) Frontal lobe Temporal lobe Parietal lobe Occipital lobe B. Initial dissection Looking down on the brain from above, we make a sagittal cut from front to back along the medial longitudinal fissure, between the superior colliculi, through the cerebellum, and through the brain stem, approximately as indicated in figure 2. Fig. 2: Sheep’s brain viewed dorsally, showing the initial sagittal cut. Looking at one half of the sheep’s brain you should be able to locate the structures in the list below. Make notes and drawings that will support you in doing so during the online test. Grey matter White matter (esp. arbor vitae of cerebellum) Corpus callosum Lateral ventricle Third and fourth ventricles Thalamus Hypothalamus Pineal gland C. Further dissection We next make coronal cuts through the frontal lobe, as indicated approximately by ‘A’ in figure 3. Fig. 3: Right half of a sheep’s brain, showing the approximate locations of medial cuts for this dissection. Viewing the cut surfaces, you should be able to identify the following features. Make notes and drawings that will help you do so during the online test. Gyri (sing. Gyrus) Sulci (sing. Sulcus) White matter Grey matter During the demonstration, view your sheep’s brain cortex microscope slide by naked eye. On your slide you will see the lateral ventricle and striatum (one of the basal ganglia of cerebral cortex) in cross section (see figure 4). You will next try to find this cross section in your sheep’s brain. Fig. 4: A coronal section through the cortex of a sheep’s brain. Returning to the dissection, we now make more coronal cuts working posteriorly from the first (as indicated by ‘B’ in figure 3). These cuts should be made at roughly 5mm increments, and after each cut, we view the cut surfaces to see whether we can see the lateral ventricle. When we have reached the approximate position of our slide section, identify the following and make notes and drawings as previously. You should be able to identify these both from dissected material and the prepared microscope slide. Lateral ventricle Striatum Corpus callosum Grey matter White matter We now make a coronal cut at the approximate position of ‘C’ in figure 3. As we work posteriorly from here, making additional coronal cuts at 5mm intervals as we did before, we should be able to locate the thalamus and hypothalamus, with the hippocampus curving around it like a c-shaped shell (see figure 5). Fig. 5: A section through a sheep’s brain showing the thalamus and the ends of the hippocampus. As coronal cuts continue posteriorly, more of the hippocampus will become visible.

To prevent contamination of your writing implements, microscopes, and slides, those materials must now be put away or collected in. Instructions will be provided using the lab monitor system, and teaching staff are on hand to help you understand your dissection. WHEN YOU HAVE FINISHED IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT TISSUES AND GLOVES ARE DISPOSED OF AS INSTRUCTED BY THE TEACHING TEAM. YOU MUST WASH YOUR HANDS THOROUGHLY PRIOR TO LEAVING THE LAB.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
