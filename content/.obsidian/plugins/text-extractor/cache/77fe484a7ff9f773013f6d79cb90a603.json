(a) Correctly label the four structures indicated by the lines on the diagram below. [10%] * (b) Give a detailed description of the function of the organelle shown in photomicrograph (a)? [20%] Page 3 of 6 (c) Following the advice given in this module, draw a detailed diagram of a prokaryotic cell labelling the following structures: nucleoid, cell wall, cell membrane, cytoplasm, ribosome, flagellum, capsule, plasmid, pili. [25%] Page 4 of 6 (d) Describe the function and biochemical composition of five of the structures labelled in diagram (c). [20%] (e) Explain the reasons for the similarities between the photomicrograph in (a) and your diagram in (c) [25%] Page 5 of 6 2. HeLa cells can be cultured in XYZ medium supplemented with glucose. Here is a protocol: a) State the concentration of glucose as %w/v in the final medium. [5%] b) The structure of glucose is: Calculate the concentration of glucose in moles per litre in the final medium (show your working). The relevant relative atomic masses are : carbon = 12, hydrogen = 1, oxygen = 16. [25%] XYZ medium preparation protocol (1 Litre) • Place 800ml of distilled water in a 1 litre volumetric flask. • Add a vial of powder for 1 litre to the water and mix gently until completely dissolved. • Add 10 g glucose • Adjust pH to 7.4 using HCl or NaOH. • Add distilled water up to the 1 litre line. • Decant into an autoclavable bottle. • Autoclave at 121 oC for 20 minutes. • Wipe surfaces with absolute ethanol prior to inoculation work • Pipette 100 mL XYZ medium into tissue culture flasks and store at 4 oC for up to 1 week. Page 6 of 6 c) Explain why the medium powder is initially added to 800 mL and not 1 litre of water. [10%] d) Explain the importance of autoclaving the medium. [10%] e) Describe how glucose is metabolised by cells. [50%] END OF PAPER","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
