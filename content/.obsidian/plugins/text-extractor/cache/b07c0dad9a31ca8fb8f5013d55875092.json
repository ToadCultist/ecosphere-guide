Timey-Wimey Stuff Time dilation increases exponentially at relativistic velocities Light speed = 300,000km/s Watch: Flight of the Navigator (Randal Kleiser, 1986) Time Warp Again Woah, That’s Heavy Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity: 1. The Universe has 4 Dimensions 2. The fabric of spacetime is flexible Watch: Interstellar (Christopher Nolan, 2014) How to travel back in time? …Find a shortcut! 4 steps to Wormhole Time Travel: 1. Find / manufacture wormhole 2. Induce time shift 3. Hold wormhole open 4. Travel to the future & back Tunnels through Time Read: Wormholes, Time Machines and the Weak Energy Condition (Kip Thorne (et al.), 1988) Paradoxes to Ponder 1. Causal Loop • A future event is the cause of a past event which is the cause of the future event 2. “Grandfather Paradox“ • Altering the past causes a contradiction in the present Watch: The Terminator (James Cameron, 1984) Watch: Back to the Future (Robert Zemeckis, 1985) Time Cops Alternative realities vs Temporal consistency Stephen Hawking’s Chronology Protection Agency vs TimeCop A Timely Conclusion Assignment: Analyze the extent to which sci-fi movies obey the scientific “rules” of time travel, with reference to physical approaches, restrictions and paradoxes 1,500 words Due: 5th November, 11:59pm Further Reading 1.
