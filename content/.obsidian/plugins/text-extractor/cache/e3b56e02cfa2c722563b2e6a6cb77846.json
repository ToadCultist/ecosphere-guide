Early Earth • Early earth was a hostile environment… • Atmosphere: N2, CO2, H2O, CH4, NH3…. • VERY LITTLE FREE OXYGEN (O2). • Very hot…oceans are thought to have been between 30-55°C (Archean Eon)! • No O3 (ozone) layer – high levels of UV. • Oceans formed 4.4-3.9 bya: very hot 80-100°C with a pH 6. Prokaryote Evolution • Prokaryotic life first evolved around 3.8 bya. • Stromatolites communities present around the globe. • Early photosynthesisers did not produce oxygen (did not use water as their electron donor). • Oxygenic photosynthesis evolved around 2.7 bya. Eukaryotic Evolution • Eukaryotic life first evolved around 2.7 bya. • Endosymbiotic event involving a prokaryote ingesting a cyanobacterium to form a photosynthesizing eukaryote. chloroplast Primary host cell mitochondrion Primary host cell nucleus cyanobacterium Red alga Glaucophyte Green algaPrimary host α-proteobacterium? Algae Evolution • The primary endosymbiotic event gave rise to three lineages:  Glaucophytes  Red algae  Green algae Chlorophytes • Embryophyta (terrestrial plants) evolved from the Class Charophycea. • They share common characteristics with land plants including:  Cellulose cell walls.  Starch synthesis and storage in the stroma of the chloroplast.  Chl b, lutein and ß carotene.  Granal stacks.  Two membranes around their chloroplasts. Chlorophytes • A few spp. have a reproductive cycle with a multicellular haploid gametophyte and diploid sporophyte stage: diplobiontic.  Gametophyte: produce male and female gametes  Sporophyte: produces haploid spores which grow into the gametophyte. • A diplobiontic life cycle provides many advantages when on land… Chlorophytes • Alternation of generations. • Multicellular haploid gametophyte and multicellular diploid sporophyte. Terrestrial Invasion! • Evidence of land colonisation by mid-Ordovician (470 Ma). • Environmental changes during Cambrian and Ordovician:  Increase in the area of terrestrial habitat available for colonisation.  Formation of soil.  Climatic changes. Terrestrial Invasion! • Physiological and morphological changes occurred:  Diplobiontic life cycle enables: the retention of the embryo, enables thousands of spores to be produced, and enabled the occupation of two different niches.  Elaboration of the sporophyte stage.  Evolution of vascular elements (475 Ma).  Evolution of the cuticle (450 Ma).  Evolution of sores resistant to desiccation (420 Ma).  Evolution of stomata (420 Ma).  Evolution of lignin (415 Ma) Terrestrial Invasion! • Physiological and morphological changes occurred:  Short wide stems with water conducting elements in the centre and photosynthetic cells beneath the surface.  Evolution of early roots (408 Ma). Relationship to Bryophytes • Evidence to suggest that early plants were similar to extant bryophytes: mosses, liverworts, hornworts etc. • Ancestral type existed 470-440 Ma.By KirinX at en.wikipedia - Own work, CC BY-SA 2.5, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=11035359","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
