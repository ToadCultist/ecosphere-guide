Most of today’s major groups found in fossil record from this time! Burgess Shale Fauna: Credit to Carel Brest van Kempen (1989) 3 SOME REVISION: HOW WOULD YOU ORGANISE THESE ANIMALS??? 4 ✓We classify to enable us to study evolution and the relationships between organisms. ✓Much of our classification aims to sort organisms according to the evolutionary relationship- i.e. where did different organisms come from? QUESTION: ‘WHY DO WE CLASSIFY?’ 5KINGDOM - ANIMALIA ✓Between 33% and 91% invertebrate species remain undescribed ✓Over 95% are invertebrates ✓82% of these are arthropods ✓82% of those are insects ✓87% belong to two phyla ✓92% belong to three phyla ✓25 phyla make up just 1% of known animal species IUCN 2015, David Lin 6 ANIMAL KINGDOM Major Invertebrate phyla ✓Porifera ✓Cnidaria ✓Platyhelminthes ✓Nematoda ✓Annelida ✓Mollusca ✓Arthropoda ✓Echinodermata - Sponges - Jellyfish, anemones, corals - Flatworm, tapeworms - Roundworms - True worms (e.g. earthworms) - Snails, clams, squid, octopus - Crustaceans, insects, scorpions, spiders - Sea stars, urchins, holothurians etc 7 PRINCIPLES OF CLASSIFICATION ✓The process of evolution produces a pattern of relationships between species. ✓As lineages evolve and split and modifications are inherited, their evolutionary paths diverge. ✓This produces a branching pattern of evolutionary relationships. ✓By studying inherited characteristics between species (and other evidence), we can reconstruct evolutionary relationships and represent them on a \"family tree,\" called a phylogeny. 8Using morphology to establish phylogeny ✓Traditional methods Compare similar characteristics and decide whether they occur via convergence or common ancestry (embryology and fossil record to help confirm ideas). ✓Phenetic taxonomy Organisms with greatest number of similar characteristics (>100) are grouped, regardless of evolutionary relationships. Problems with homoplasy. ✓Cladistic analysis (‘Phylogenetic classification’). Grouped according to ‘recency’ of common ancestry. Defined by way of shared derived characteristics (synapomorphies or homologies). The objective is to identify to the last common ancestor- monophyly. 9 BILATERIAN EVOLUTION Traditional view based on morphology and embryology: ✓= ‘Simple’ organisms emerged first, followed with increasing complexity Acoelomates Pseudocoelomates Coelomates 10HOMOLOGOUS CHARACTERISTICS (‘SYNAPOMORPHIES’) ✓Segmentation ✓Cuticle made of chitin ✓Bilateral symmetry ✓Circumoesphageal nerve ring ✓Presence of chemically reactive proteins in tissues (HRP) 11 QUESTION: WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL PITFALLS OF USING SHARED FEATURES AS CLUES TO RELATEDNESS? ✓Convergent versus divergent evolution ✓Some characteristics lost over time may give the impression of being primitive but, actually have been lost secondarily (e.g. wingless insects) 12 SYSTEMATICS AND CLASSIFICATION HAS BEEN EVOLVING TOO! ✓Late 1980s saw advent of nucleotide sequencing (DNA) ✓Enabled a rigorous approach ✓This new ‘era’ incorporated statistical evaluation of analyses. ✓Difficult to classify organisms were now resolved e.g. pentastomids (tongueworms) are crustaceans and chaetognaths are a separate phylum! 13 MOLECULAR APPROACHES ✓Molecular markers such as genes and proteins are used to establish phylogeny. ✓Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and advanced sequencing technologies (NGS) have massively expanded our range of targets to analyse……. 14 COMMONLY USED MOLECULAR MARKERS ✓Ribosomal DNA (encoding rRNA), 18S rRNA- the first go-to gene ✓Mitochndrial DNA (e.g. cytochrome oxidase subunit 1) ✓Protein coding genes (for higher level analysis) ✓Hox genes (to be covered in later lecture) 15COMMONLY USED MOLECULAR MARKERS Example: Crustacean diuretic hormone 31 (DH31) amino acid sequences Alexander et al., Front Neurosci (2018) 12:454. doi: 10.3389/fnins.2018.00454 16 Example: Tree based on crustacean DH31 amino acid sequences 17 COMMON THREADS BETWEEN APPARENTLY DISTANT RELATIVES ✓Sequencing has enabled us to see that common sets of genes are found in different species- rather than what people first thought; that different species were ‘different’ due to species-specific genes! ✓Hox genes are an example here- found in pretty much all metazoa, but ‘sets’ of these genes differ between clades e.g. Lophotrochozoa, Ecdysozoa and Deuterostomia. 18 FROM LIMITED GENES TO (ALMOST) LIMITLESS SEQUENCING! ✓Since 2000s sequencing technologies have developed at an exponential rate- whole genomes in no time at all! Early 2000s the ‘bread and butter’ genes remained as 18S rRNA, 28S rRNA, ELF1a and myosin. ✓CO1, Cytb and 16S rRNA mutate quite rapidly and so used for species level- i.e. more recent divergence (hence CO1 for barcoding). ✓In 2005 multigene and genome analyses aided resolution of the high-order, or deep phylogenetics. ✓Example- Ctenophora/Porifera as sister group (more on that later….) 1920 ANIMAL PHYLOGENY BASED ON MOLECULAR DATA (HALYNACH, 2004) 21 THOSE PESKY NEMATODES! ✓Placing of nematodes relative to other groups is an example of how analysing genomes and genes can bring about arguments! ✓Multi-genome analyses have shown nematodes to be a basal group in the bilateria- in direct contrast to more traditional approach outcomes. ✓ However, it is now pretty certain this is a computing/analysis artefact ‘Long branch attraction’ (LBA)- see Phillipe et al. (2005) and Telford et al. (2008) 22 From: What Makes an Animal? The Molecular Quest for the Origin of the Animal Kingdom Integr Comp Biol.

Are they a sister group to Porifera? Or vice versa? ✓How did neurons arise independently when they are so complex? ✓For that matter, how did segmentation in arthropods (Ecdysozoa) and annelids (Lophotrochozoa) arise separately when it’s so fundamental to their existence? 24 EXAMPLE ISSUES ‘RESOLVED’ BY MOLECULAR ‘DIGGING’ OF CTENOPHORES AND OTHER ORGANISMS 25 SO, WHAT TO DO? • So, in summary- morphology is hard to score across diverse phyla, and assumptions about homology of characters are tough to support. Phylogenies should be constructed with molecular data and supported by homology/morphology. 26 DIVISION OF METAZOA Based on body plan, morphology, development and biochemical/molecular evidence An introduction to the invertebrates (Janet Moore), CUP 2728 Next lecture: Major invertebrate groups","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
