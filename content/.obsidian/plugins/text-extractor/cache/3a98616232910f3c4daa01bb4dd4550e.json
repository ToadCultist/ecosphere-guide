Biology: How Life Works (2nd or 3rd Edition). Week beginning 03/10/23 • Structure of DNA; replication Chapter 3 All living things possess DNA (and/or RNA) and use the same genetic code Evidence that all life evolved from a common ancestor ? Structure of DNA DNA is composed of individual nucleotides It can exist as a single-stranded molecule But is more often found as a double-stranded helix. Deoxyribose sugar Phosphate group Nucleobase Using the appropriate microscopy techniques, bacterial DNA in its uncoiled state can be imaged DNA is normally found as very long molecules but is compacted into the nucleus by packaging it around histones and supercoiling Supercoil Coil Nucleosome Histone proteins Condensed chromatid 1400 nm in diameter 6 Chromatin fiber 30 nm in diameter 3 DNA duplex 2 nm in diameter 1 Nucleosome 10 nm in diameter 2 Coiled chromatin fiber 300 nm in diameter 4 Coiled coil 700 nm in diameter 5 DNA is compacted into the nucleus by packaging it around histones and supercoiling Adenine (A) Purines Guanine (G) Pyrimidines Cytosine (C) Guanine (G) Thymine (T) Cytosine (C) Deoxyribose sugar Phosphate group Nucleotides of DNA have three components: Nucleobase Nucleotides held together by phosphodiester bonds between the phosphates and sugars 5'-phosphate group Phosphodiester bond 3'-hydroxyl group C – O – P – O – C A phosphodiester linkage forms between the 3’ C of the sugar in thymine and the P of the phosphate group in guanine. Water is lost so it’s a condensation reaction. A pyrimidine nucleotide (eg. thymine) A purine nucleotide (eg. guanine) Condensation reaction to form a phosphodiester bond The chemistry of a phosphodiester bond Phosphodiester bonds form long chains of single-stranded DNA. But what holds the sequences together and what pairs with what? 5’ 5’ 5’ 5’ Hydrogen bonds The uprights of the ladder fix the space between them for base-pairing A – T pairs and C – G pairs because: ‘Space’ and ‘number of H bonds’ Two purines are too big Two pyrimidines are too small A and T can make only 2 H bonds G and C can make 3 H bonds DNA vs. RNA Both polymers of nucleotides but the sugar is different RNA Deoxyribose On C2, Ribose has a hydroxyl (–OH) group where deoxyribose has a hydrogen (–H). Ribose DNA DNA uses the nucleobase thymine but RNA uses uracil Uracil has a hydrogen (–H) where thymine has a methyl (–CH3) group. RNA only DNA only In RNA the Pyrimidine Uracil replaces Thymine Transcription Translation DNA mRNA Protein Ribosome Proteins provide structure and carry out many essential activities in a cell eg enzymes. The Central ‘Dogma’ (accepted idea) of gene expression: That DNA stores the genetic code DNA transfers (transcribes) the code into RNA The RNA code is translated into proteins that carry out the functions of the cell DNA carries the genetic code. Each time a cell divides, the DNA in the nucleus must first replicate itself. DNA replication occurs in the S phase of the cell cycle and needs specific enzymes: Topoisomerase and helicase that unwind the DNA helix DNA polymerase and ligase that join individual nucleotides and synthesise new DNA strands. DNA replication is ‘semi-conservative’. One strand of the parental DNA is conserved in each of the new molecules formed. Parental strands Daughter strands 5’ 3’ 3’ 5’ 3’ 5’ Leading strand Lagging strand The double stranded parental sequence serves as a template for the synthesis of two daughter strands. Each new double-stranded daughter sequence is made of one original (parental) strand and one newly- synthesized strand. Original DNA sequence is conserved DNA uncoils and the nucleotide order (code) is conserved in the new DNA strands that are synthesised Topoisomerase Helicase Proteins that protect the DNA while it is single-stranded Topoisomerase and helicase enzymes uncoil the DNA Other proteins protect the single-stranded DNA DNA polymerase can add new nucleotides in the 5’ to 3’ direction only. Parental strands Daughter strands 5’ 3’ 3’ 5’ 3’ 5’ Leading strand Lagging strand On the leading strand DNA polymerase is moving towards the replication fork so add nucleotides to the 3’ end of the new strand and can copy continuously. On the lagging strand, DNA polymerase must work away from the replication fork so must copy in short chunks that are subsequently joined together.
