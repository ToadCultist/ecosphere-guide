Voluntary; Causes movementsSkeletal muscle Bundle of muscle fibers Muscle Single muscle fiber (cell) Nuclei Z lines Plasma membrane Myofibril Sarcomere T-tubules (transverse tubules) Each muscle fibre contains myofibrils Thin filaments (actin), 8nm Thick filaments (myosin), 16nm Elastic/supporting filaments Repeating units of microfilaments called sarcomeres The SarcomereThick filaments Consist of 200 protein molecules (Myosin) Projecting myosin heads extend towards thin filaments Thin filaments  Main structural component: ACTIN  Binding site for myosin  Two regulatory proteins: a) Tropomyosin  covers myosin binding site in relaxed muscle b) Troponin  holds tropomyosin in position Elastic filaments  Composed of titin protein  Anchors & stabilises thick filament  Helps recover sarcomere length after contraction  Non-elastic nebulin stabilises thin filament Muscle Physiology • Muscle structure • Muscle contraction • Neuromuscular junctions • Types of muscle fibre The sliding filament theory of contraction Pre 1950s: Folding process? Mid 1954: Sliding Filament Theory Why? Myosin heads can hydrolyse ATP Convert to high-energy form that can bind actin = cross bridges Fig. 50-27-4 Thin filaments ATP Myosin head (low- energy configuration Thick filament Thin filament Thick filament Actin Myosin head (high- energy configuration Myosin binding sites ADP P i Cross-bridge ADP P i Myosin head (low- energy configuration Thin filament moves toward center of sarcomere. ATP ADP P i+ CYCLE REPEATS IF MORE ATP AND CALCIUM PROVIDED IN HIGH LEVELS Contraction requires lots of ATP Lots of sarcomeres… • In series: Increases degree of shortening • In parallel: Increases force generation • Mix of both: optimal balance Relationship between length and tension Muscle Physiology • Muscle structure • Muscle contraction • Neuromuscular junctions • Types of muscle fibre Myogenic & neurogenic muscles • Myogenic muscle cells • Contract spontaneously • e.g. Small % autorhythmic fibres in vertebrate heart • Neurogenic muscle cells • Stimulated by action of neurons • e.g. vertebrate skeletal muscles NT=ACh Postsynaptic cell = muscle fibre Motor end plate – region of sarcolemma The neuromuscular junction (NMJ)Motor units One motor neuron, its axon terminals & the skeletal muscle fibres innervated by them. Muscle at rest...  Tropomyosin  Covers myosin binding sites  Troponin  Holds tropomyosin in position  Excitation must remove ‘block’ Muscle fibres are irritable ACh causes the sarcolemma of the muscle to depolarise (= a muscle action potential) Conduction over sarcolemma Synaptic terminal of motor neuron Synaptic cleft T Tubule Plasma membrane ACh Sarcoplasmic reticulum & T-tubules Fig. 50-29b Ca 2+ ATPase pump Synaptic terminal of motor neuron Synaptic cleft T Tubule Plasma membrane Ca2+ Ca 2+ CYTOSOL SR ATP ADP P i ACh Depolarisation & Ca2+ release Ca2+ binds to troponin Tropomyosin-troponin complex slides away Cross bridges can form Muscle Relaxation Muscle Action Potential ceases…  Ca 2+ release channels close Pumps rapidly remove Ca2+ from cytoplasm to SR, & Calsequestrin protein helps mop up Ca2+ Actin binding site for myosin head re-covered by tropomyosin-troponin complex Inhibitory motor neurons only in invertebrates Curare Blow dart poison extracted from plant resin Curare competes with ACh for postsynaptic receptors, occupies the receptors, but does not open ion channels What is the result for the animal that has been darted? Electric organs • Electrocytes mostly derived from muscle tissue (but neural tissue in Aperonotus) • Can be arranged in series to increase discharge voltage • Can be arranged in parallel to increase discharge current Sensation and control: muscle contraction • Muscle contraction • Neuromuscular junctions • Types of muscle fibre • Use the next several slides to guide extra reading on muscle fibre types. • See (for example) Campbell & Reece (2008), p1111. • Ask me if you have questions! (rds5@aber.ac.uk) Muscle fibre types • Oxidative vs glycolytic • Oxidative fibres rely mainly on aerobic respiration • Lots of mitochondria, myoglobin, and good blood supply • Glycolytic fibres rely mainly on glycolysis • Less myoglobin, fatigue faster • Fast-twitch vs slow-twitch • Contraction speed differs • Slow fibres have less SR, and myosin heads hydrolyze ATP more slowly • Most muscles have both fibre types • Eye and hand fast-twitch only Endurance training & muscle: number of mitochondria Changes in fast fibre types during training & detraining Slow oxidative Fast oxidative Fast glycolytic Remodeling of motor units with ageing In ageing muscles some fast motor units are lost Record speeds achieved by athletes decrease with age","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
