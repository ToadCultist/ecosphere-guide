In Brief Peters et al. infer a time-calibrated and statistically solid phylogenetic tree of the mega-diverse insect order Hymenoptera (sawﬂies, wasps, ants, and bees) from the analysis of phylogenomic data. This sheds new light on the early history of this intriguing group, as well as on the origins and radiation of parasitoids, stinging wasps, and bees. Peters et al., 2017, Current Biology 27, 1013–1018 April 3, 2017 ª 2017 Elsevier Ltd. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2017.01.027 dataset with sequenced and annotated genomes of ﬁve hyme- nopterans and a beetle (for details, see Supplemental Experi- mental Procedures and Data S1A–S1D). Our study includes 54 families of Hymenoptera, representing all major superfamilies. The phylogenetic inferences are based on the analysis of 1.5 million amino acid and 3.0 million nucleotide positions, respec- tively, derived from 3,256 single-copy protein-coding genes (Data S1E) and inferred by using a combination of domain-, gene-, and codon position-based data partition schemes to improve the ﬁtting of the applied substitution models. Consid- ering the taxonomic and molecular sampling, this is the most comprehensive dataset ever generated for investigating phylo- genetic relationships within Hymenoptera or any other insect group. The dataset was furthermore used to estimate divergence times with an independent-rates as well as with a correlated- rates molecular clock approach (Data S1H) and a validated set of 14 fossils (Data S1F). The inferred phylogenetic relationships and divergence time estimates were used to assess where in the phylogeny of Hyme- noptera, when in their geological history, and how often major evolutionary transitions took place. Speciﬁcally, we studied the switch from feeding on plants to feeding on an insect host (para- sitoidism), the formation of a wasp waist, the evolution of a venomous stinger to subdue mobile hosts, the evolution of euso- ciality, and the switch from hunting prey to collecting pollen. These evolutionary transitions are partially reﬂected by the his- toric classiﬁcation of Hymenoptera: sawﬂies (‘‘Symphyta’’) are those Hymenoptera that lack the wasp waist that characterizes all remaining Hymenoptera (Apocrita), ‘‘Parasitica’’ encom- passes the primarily parasitoid Apocrita that lack a stinger, and Aculeata comprises the stinging wasps, ants, and bees (Antho- phila) [1]. Yet, how many major lineages each of these groups encompasses has been controversial for decades [4–11]. The results of our phylogenomic study received strong sup- port in all analyses, unless stated otherwise, and alter previous ideas regarding the evolutionary history of Hymenoptera (Fig- ure 1B; for full results and detailed experimental procedures, see Figure S1, Supplemental Experimental Procedures, and additional ﬁgures deposited at Mendeley Data, http://dx.doi. org/10.17632/s5j2f62z3d.2). According to our analyses, extant Hymenoptera started to diversify between the Carboniferous and the Triassic (95% conﬁdence interval [CI]: 329–239 million years ago [mya]; mean: 281 mya; node 1 [n.1] in Figure 1B), with the oldest currently known Hymenoptera fossils being from the Triassic, \u0001224 million years old [8]. Previous studies suggested this divergence to have occurred between the sawﬂy lineage Xyeloidea and the remaining Hymenoptera [5, 7–11], whereas our analysis identiﬁed a much more inclusive clade of sawﬂies (Eusymphyta; n.2) that also contains Pamphilioidea and Tenthredinoidea as closest relatives of all remaining Hyme- noptera (Unicalcarida). These superfamilies had been thought to form a paraphyletic grade [5, 7, 9, 11]. Instead, they represent an unexpected and previously unrecognized major radiation of pri- marily ectophytophagous insects that comprises more than 7,000 described species [1]. We estimate the ﬁrst diversiﬁcation of the extant eusymphytan lineages to have occurred 276–157 mya (mean 212 mya). Note that Eusymphyta were corroborated as the sister group of all remaining Hymenoptera when addition- ally scrutinizing the analyzed molecular data for conﬂicting phylogenetic signal (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Given the novelty and importance of our ﬁnding, we anticipate that it will signiﬁcantly inﬂuence future research on Hymenoptera relationships, and we encourage researchers to further assess this particular phylogenetic hypothesis in future studies, for example by extending the taxon sampling within Eusymphyta and the outgroup. A clade Eusymphyta representing the extant sister lineage of all remaining Hymenoptera (Unicalcarida) has profound conse- quences for inferring ground-plan characters of Hymenoptera. For example, Hymenoptera were previously thought to have been ancestrally ectophytophagous, based on the assumption that eusymphytans form a paraphyletic assemblage. Consid- ering that the sister group of Hymenoptera (Aparaglossata) was ancestrally likely predacious [12], the inferred relationship between Eusymphyta and Unicalcarida implies that the most recent common ancestor of Hymenoptera could have been ecto- or endophytophagous. A sister group relationship between Eusymphyta and Unicalcarida furthermore implies that the remarkable ability of male Hymenoptera to restore diploidy in their muscle cells was already present in the last common ancestor of all Hymenoptera (with a secondary loss in Xyelidae), or that this feature evolved at least twice (in Unicalcarida and Tenthredinoidea) [13]. Finally, the unexpected ﬁnding that the turnip sawﬂy, Athalia rosae (Tenthredinoidea), whose genome has recently been sequenced by the i5K initiative [14], is a repre- sentative of the sister lineage of all remaining Hymenoptera will improve our understanding of the genetic composition of the most recent common ancestor of Hymenoptera: genomic fea- tures shared between the turnip sawﬂy and species of Unicalcar- ida with sequenced genomes (e.g., Nasonia parasitoid wasps, ants, bees) were likely inherited from their common ancestor. In agreement with earlier studies [9, 10], we found a single origin of the endophytic sawﬂy lineages (i.e., Cephoidea, Orus- soidea, Siricoidea, and Xiphydrioidea; n.3), which form a para- phyletic grade, in which Orussoidea (parasitoid woodwasps) represent the closest relatives of Apocrita (n.4). Morphological data have suggested a sister group relationship of Orussoidea and Apocrita (Vespina) [6, 15], but results from analyzing molec- ular data have been inconsistent [7, 9]. Our analyses provide strong support for the monophyly of Vespina and of Apocrita (n.5) and imply that the bulk of primarily parasitoid wasps are de- scendants of a single endophytic parasitoid ancestor that lived in the Permian or in the Triassic (CI: 289–211 mya; mean: 247 mya). Contrary to earlier hypotheses of sawﬂy relationships (see [10]), we identiﬁed Cephoidea, and not Siricoidea and/or Xiphydrioi- dea, as the closest extant relatives of Vespina (n.6), a result only recently suggested [7]. The evolution of the wasp waist, a constriction between the ﬁrst and the second abdominal segment greatly improving the maneuverability of the abdomen’s rear section, including the ovipositor, was a major innovation in the evolution of Hyme- noptera that undoubtedly contributed to the rapid diversiﬁcation of Apocrita (n.5) [6]. Our analysis is the ﬁrst to persuasively demonstrate that the most diverse parasitoid wasp lineages (i.e., Ceraphronoidea, Ichneumonoidea, and Proctotrupomor- pha) constitute a natural group (Parasitoida; n.7) whose aston- ishing radiation was likely triggered by further optimization of the parasitoid lifestyle and related traits (e.g., endoparasitoidism, 1014 Current Biology 27, 1013–1018, April 3, 2017 Pamphilioidea Xyeloidea Tenthredinoidea Xiphydrioidea Siricoidea Cephoidea Orussoidea Ichneumonoidea Ceraphronoidea Cynipoidea Platygastroidea Proctotrupoidea Diaprioidea Evanioidea Stephanoidea Trigonaloidea Chrysidoidea Tiphioidea Scolioidea Ampulicidae \"Crabronidae\" Sphecidae Anthophila bees digger wasps Formicoidea ants Pompiloidea velvet ants, spider wasps, and relatives Chalcidoidea jewel wasps Vespoidea potter, honey and social waspsApoidea Bootstrap support 100% 51–75% 91–99% 76–90% 0–50% Tiphia Cephalonomia Bembix Monosapyga Harpegnathos Tetragonula Dryudella Sapgya Dasymutilla Gorytes Diodontus Philanthus Sirex outgroup (5) Stephanus Xyela Pergagrapta Harpactus Vespa Sphecius Dolichurus Urocerus Auplopus Acromyrmex Smicromyrme Tremex Stizus Ampulex c.

Key evolutionary events are indicated at the respective clades (note that only the major eusocial lineages are considered). The tree was inferred under the maximum-likelihood optimality criterion, analyzing 1,505,514 amino acid sites and applying a combination of protein domain- and gene-speciﬁc substitution models. Divergence times were estimated with an independent-rates molecular clock approach and considering 14 validated fossils.

Current Biology 27, 1013–1018, April 3, 2017 1015 miniaturization), which allowed for successfully attacking a variety of new hosts. We estimate the beginning of the group’s radiation at 266–195 mya (mean: 228 mya), only a few million years after Parasitoida separated from the remaining Apocrita (CI: 276–203 mya; mean: 236 mya). The early radiation of Para- sitoida thus falls within a time period when the parasitoids’ major host lineages (e.g., Hemiptera, Holometabola) also started to diversify [16]. We identiﬁed the enigmatic Trigonaloidea as the closest extant relatives of Aculeata with strong node support (n.8), a hy- pothesis only recently put forth [7, 9]. Evanioidea, which had also been discussed as a possible sister group of Aculeata [5, 10, 17, 18], cluster with Stephanoidea (n.9). Node support for this rela- tionship is low, however, and it needs to be investigated further in future studies that include additional types of characters and samples of Megalyroidea, a lineage that we were unable to sequence. Note that in contrast to Aculeata, the Evanioidea, Ste- phanoidea, and Trigonaloidea have all remained species-poor. The identiﬁcation of the closest relatives of Aculeata will be important for better understanding which traits (e.g., venoms) fostered the diversiﬁcation of the stinging wasps. Our analysis sheds new light on the phylogeny of Aculeata (n.10), whose early diversiﬁcation occurred 224–160 mya (mean: 190 mya). Chrysidoids are conﬁrmed as the sister group of all remaining Aculeata [19]. We corroborate the artiﬁcial nature of the former superfamily ‘‘Vespoidea’’ (i.e., all Aculeata except Apoidea and Chrysidoidea) [5], which comprises four major lineages that are paraphyletic with respect to Apoidea [20]. The potter, honey, and social wasps (Vespoidea sensu Pilgrim et al. [20]: Vespidae; n.11) were identiﬁed as the sister lineage of all remaining non-chrysidoid Aculeata. However, the phylogenetic position of the species-poor Rhopalosomatidae (Vespoidea sensu Pilgrim et al. [20]), an aculeate wasp family that we were unable to sequence and possible sister lineage of Vespidae, re- mains controversial [9, 10, 20]. The inferred phylogenetic rela- tionships within Vespidae suggest two independent origins of eusociality, a previously ﬁercely contested hypothesis [21, 22]. In agreement with an earlier phylogenomic study [23], we in- ferred ants (Formicoidea) as being the closest extant relatives of Apoidea (n.12) in all of our analyses, except when applying a Bayesian approach, which suggested ants plus scoliid wasps (Scolioidea, possibly including also the family Bradynobaenidae [20], which we were unable to sequence) as being sister to Apo- idea (ﬁgure deposited at Mendeley Data, http://dx.doi.org/10. 17632/s5j2f62z3d.2). We estimate the last common ancestor of ants and Apoidea to have lived in the Jurassic or the Creta- ceous (CI: 192–136 mya; mean: 162 mya). We located the phylogenetic origin of bees (Anthophila) within the apoid wasp family ‘‘Crabronidae’’ (n.13), which our study shows to be an artiﬁcial construct comprising ﬁve major line- ages. The crabronid wasp lineage in our study most closely related to bees is the species-poor tribe Psenini. This result sub- stantiates the idea that the switch from a predatory to a herbi- vorous lifestyle was a key to the tremendous diversiﬁcation of bees [24]. We estimate the origin of bees to have been in the Cretaceous (CIs: 147–93 mya; means: 124 and 111 mya), a result that is consistent with a close temporal link between the diversi- ﬁcations of bees and angiosperms [24]. Melittid bees were iden- tiﬁed as the sister lineage of all remaining Anthophila (n.14), which implies that short-tongued bees do not represent a natural group. In contrast, we conﬁrmed long-tongued bees (i.e., Apidae and Megachilidae) to constitute a natural entity (n.15) [24]. We also found the eusocial apid bee lineages to be monophyletic, corroborating the hypothesis that eusociality has evolved once, not twice, in corbiculate (pollen basket) bees (n.16) [25]. Our study conﬁrms the power of phylogenomic approaches for deciphering difﬁcult-to-resolve arthropod phylogenetic rela- tionships [12, 16, 26, 27] by yielding well-supported answers to some of the most pressing questions regarding the evolutionary history of the sawﬂies, wasps, ants, and bees. We provide strong evidence for understanding the phylogenetic relationships among all major lineages of Hymenoptera, and we were able to date the individual divergence events, both paramount for de- ciphering the tempo and mode of diversiﬁcation of ecologically, economically, sociobiologically, and/or pharmaceutically rele- vant traits of interest (e.g., gene repertoires, haplodiploidy and sex determination, eusociality, chemosensation, and venoms). Finally, our study offers the basis for establishing a natural clas- siﬁcation of the insect order Hymenoptera. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES We sequenced the transcriptomes of 134 species of Hymenoptera using Illu- mina HiSeq 2000 sequencing technology (Data S1A–S1C). We complemented our dataset by including previously published transcriptomes of 29 Hymeno- ptera and four Neuropteroidea [16, 28]. Finally, we considered the ofﬁcial gene sets of ﬁve Hymenoptera and the ﬂour beetle Tribolium castaneum (Data S1D). All paired-end reads were assembled with SOAPdenovo-Trans- 31kmer (version 1.01) [29], the assembled transcripts were ﬁltered for possible contaminants, and the raw reads and ﬁltered assemblies were submitted to the NCBI SRA and TSA archives. We searched the assemblies with the soft- ware Orthograph (version beta4) [28] for transcripts of 3,260 protein-coding genes that the OrthoDB v7 database [30] suggested to be single-copy in Hymenoptera and Neuropteroidea (outgroup) by applying the best reciprocal hit criterion. Orthologous transcripts were aligned with MAFFT (version 7.017) [31] at the translational (amino acid) level. All multiple sequence align- ments (MSAs) were quality assessed and, if necessary, improved and masked using the procedure outlined by Misof et al. [16]. The resulting MSAs were concatenated to a supermatrix that we simultaneously partitioned based on a combination of Pfam protein domains and genes [16]. The phylogenetic information content of each partition was assessed with MARE (version 0.1.2-rc) [32], and all uninformative partitions were removed. We subsequently used PartitionFinder (developer versions 2.0.0-pre2, 2.0.0-pre9, and 2.0.0- pre10) [33] to simultaneously infer a partition scheme and proper amino acid substitution models for analyzing each partition with the rcluster algorithm. We applied the same partition scheme when analyzing the corresponding supermatrix at the transcriptional (nucleotide) level, except that we modeled the ﬁrst and second codon position of each partition separately (note that we excluded the hypervariable third codon position from our analyses). Phylo- genetic trees were reconstructed with ExaML (versions 3.0.15 and 3.0.17) [34], conducting 50 independent tree searches per supermatrix. Node support was inferred with the bootstrap method [35]. Decisive datasets were used for testing the possible impact of missing data at the partition level on the inferred phylogenetic tree [36], and four-cluster likelihood mapping was used for assessing the phylogenetic signal for alternative phylogenetic relationships [37]. Permutation tests allowed assessing the impact of heterogeneous amino acid sequence composition, non-stationarity of substitution processes, and non-random distribution of missing data on the inferred phylogenetic tree [16]. We additionally conducted phylogenetic inferences in a Bayesian frame- work, using ExaBayes [38] with its default settings, enabling automatic substi- tution model detection and applying the same data partitioning scheme that we used in analyses under the maximum-likelihood optimality criterion. We analyzed three independent runs with four coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo 1016 Current Biology 27, 1013–1018, April 3, 2017 chains and 200,000 generations each. The consense tool (part of the ExaBayes software package) was used to obtain a consensus tree based on the extended majority rule method (MRE), discarding the ﬁrst 25% of the sampled topologies as burn-in. Divergence times were calibrated using 14 fos- sils (Data S1F), selected following best-practice recommendations [39] and representing extant lineages distributed across the entire Hymenoptera Tree of Life. Divergence times were estimated with mcmctree in conjunction with codeml (both part of the PAML software package, version 4.9) [40]. We analyzed a subset of the amino acid and of the nucleotide supermatrix, both comprising only sites that had amino acids or nucleotides present in at least 95% of the species, both with an independent-rates model and with a corre- lated-rates model (Figure 1B; Data S1H) and sampling parameters previously assessed for convergence of results.
