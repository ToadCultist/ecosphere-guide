(2023) Right: salicylic acid content of tobacco after inoculation with tobacco mosaic virus Another stress-induced hormone: salicylic acid increases in infected plants Genetics → proof of salicylic acid’s role in pathogen defence • Gene nahG from Pseudomonas encodes salicylic acid degradation • Arabidopsis plants with nahG transgene cannot accumulate salicylic acid → much more susceptible to pathogen nahG plants Wild-type Infection with fungus (Peronospora parasitica) Liu et al. (2015) Salicylic acid signalling Salicylic Acid – other uses • 1920s: diffusible growth- promotor in oat seedlings • Coleoptile - pointed protective sheath covering the emerging • ‘Auxin’ from Greek auxein ‘to grow’ Auxin & Shoot Growth Auxin ‘loosens’ cell wall → cell expansion 1. Auxin stimulates ‘proton pump’ ATPases in plasma membrane → acidification of wall 2. Lower pH in wall causes ‘expansin’ proteins to ‘loosen’ wall polysaccharides → cell expansion Auxin & Phototropism • Phototropism - the ability of a plant to grow directionally in response to a light source • Auxin accumulates on the shaded side to stimulate cell wall expansion • Concentration gradient achieved via the action of PIN proteins Auxin Herbicides • Earliest herbicide ‘2,4-D’: synthetic chemical with auxin effects • Disrupts cell growth functions in treated broad leaved weeds (dicots) but grass less sensitive • Widely used in lawn weedkillers Auxin herbicides in Vietnam War • 2,4-D & 2,4,5-T (another synthetic auxin) were components of ‘Agent Orange’ – also contained trace amounts of a toxic dioxin Orange: areas sprayed • 19 million gallons defoliated Vietnam forests in late 60s Hormones in ‘crown gall disease’ Agrobacterium bacterial cell ‘Ti plasmid’Chromosome Infection & DNA transfer Cytokinin Ti plasmid gene map Tumour cell Tumour Auxin T-DNA transfer to plant in nature ‘T-DNA’ Auxin & cytokinin stimulate tumour • Infected plant cells incorporate auxin & cytokinin biosynthesis genes of Agrobacterium ‘Ti-plasmid’ • Plant cells produce opines – unique nutrient source • Only known natural prokaryote-to-eukaryote DNA transfer Hormones in Callus & Tumours Mid auxin: mid cytokinin → ‘callus’ ‘Crown gall’ tumour on tree • ‘Callus’ can form when trees wounded or suffer from tumours • Undifferentiated mass of plant cells Agrobacterium in ‘genetic modification’ Agrobacterium bacterial cell ‘Ti plasmid’Chromosome ‘T-DNA’ Infection & DNA transfer Auxin Cytokinin Ti plasmid gene map Tumour cell Tumour T-DNA transfer to plant in nature Auxin & cytokinin stimulate tumour Hormone genes cloned out New gene for plant New T-DNA New Ti plasmid cloned in Agrobacterium Infection of plant cells Transgenic plants regenerated ‘GM’ plantT-DNA transfer to plant in lab Hormones in ‘plant tissue culture’ • Key technique in plant biotechnology • Tissues on nutrient medium (with sugar & minerals) • Auxin & cytokinin control differentiation High auxin: low cytokinin → roots Mid auxin: mid cytokinin → ‘callus’ Low auxin: high cytokinin → shoots Hormones in Horticulture High auxin: low cytokinin → roots • Promotion of roots by auxin → ‘rooting’ garden products Summary • Plant hormones o → growth: gibberellins in Green Revolution semi-dwarf crops o → stress responses: ABA in drought; salicylic acid in pathogen infection o → differentiation: ethylene in fruit ripening; auxin & cytokinin in root, shoot & callus formation Image acknowledgments Wikimedia Commons, https://commons.wikimedia.org International Rice Research Institute, http://irri.org Khush (2001) Nature Reviews Genetics 2: 815-822 Shewry (2009) Journal of Experimental Botany 60: 1537-1553 Mr Anthony Pugh (Aberystwyth University) Mauseth (1995) Botany, 2nd edn.
