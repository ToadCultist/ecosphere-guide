Corn-smut (Ustilago maydis) infecting maize cobs (Huitlacoche-Mexican delicacy) Smut fungi (Ustilagomycotina) -obligate parasites, highly host-specific Anther smut (Microbotryum spp.) anthers covered by spores Horrendous lifecycles: 5 spore types 2 host plants subphylum Pucciniomycotina (rusts) Septate basidia 1 2 3 4 Puccinia graminis Extracellular enzymes (lipases, proteases, cellulases) Soluble nutrients Filamentous fungi and oomycetes obtain nutrients via OSMOTROPHY Cell wall Cell membrane Animal and many protists (inc. slime moulds) are PHAGOTROPHIC (engulf particles of food via phagocytosis and digest internally) Microbial growth curveGlucose Conc Time glucose biomass Exponential Growth Phase Stationary PhaseBiomass 1º metabolites 2º metabolites Doubling time Saccharomyces 88min Candida 56 min (slower than bacteria) eg.
