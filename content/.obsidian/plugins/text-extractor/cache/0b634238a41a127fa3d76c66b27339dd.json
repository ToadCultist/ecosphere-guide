Would the sugar-phosphate backbones of a DNA helix be held together more stably in an A-T rich sequence or a G-C rich sequence? Why?

Communication between and within cells Lecture 1 Read: Campbell et al. Chapter 9.1 – 9.4 (pages 214 - 230) Morris et al. Chapter 9 (pages 179 - 197) Cells receive large amounts of information Both from the ‘non-living’ /physical environment they are surrounded by Also from other living cells that are either touching, close by or distant. And often respond by changing what they do/make etc. Cell communication / Cell signalling Cells can react to information they receive from their surroundings by for example: • Secreting (or not secreting) something • Absorbing (or not) something • Starting (or stopping) cell division • By becoming (or not) a specialised cell etc. Why do cells communicate? There are many reasons including the need to seek out food or a mate or to respond and adapt to changes in their environment Found in all forms of life: Unicellular and multicellular Aquatic and terrestrial Prokaryote and eukaryote Cell communication first evolved in unicellular organisms that needed to sense changes and then adapt to their surroundings (intra-cellular signalling) Multicellular organisms need to communicate between cells in the same organism (inter-cellular signalling) The characteristics that living organisms share. They all:  respond to their environment  grow and change  reproduce and have offspring  have a complex chemistry  maintain homeostasis  are built of structures called cells  pass their traits onto their offspring  respond to their environment How and why do cells send and receive signals? cellular signalling has four basic components • Signalling cell • Signalling compound • Receptor (usually a protein) • Responding cell The signaling cell releases signaling molecules. Signaling molecule Receptor The responding cell has receptor proteins that bind to the signaling molecule. Signaling cell Responding cell This type of cellular communication is known as INTER-cellular signallingInter-cellular signalling Cell to cell communication Cell signalling can be divided into: Intra-cellular signalling Within cell communication ? ? Receptor Signaling molecule Signaling cell Responding cell ? Really it is a continuum of both concepts that includes signalling mechanisms within the responding cell that result in eg. changes in gene expression Start by focussing on intercellular signalling and look at two examples: One in a multicellular organism One in unicellular organism Mammalian Fight or flight response (a complex example of intercellular signalling) When humans (or other mammals) face a sudden threat The autonomic nervous system sends signals to the adrenal glands (signalling cell) Make the hormone adrenalin, also called epinephrine (signalling molecule) Carried around the body in the blood Links with specific ‘adrenergic receptors’ in muscle, lungs, heart etc (responding cells) to supress ‘housekeeping’ activities of the body and prepare it for action. Signalling cells that produce epinephrine are in central (medulla) part of the adrenal gland Although the adrenal gland contains other hormone-producing cells www.Pinterest The responding cells are in many different organs: heart, lungs, skin, pancreas etc. Watch the video (1 min 46 sec) to remind you of the ‘fight or flight response’ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdJpLvSTZMU Look at an example of intercellular signalling in a single-celled organism Uptake of DNA (eg. antibiotic resistance genes) by bacteria Bacteria evolve by ‘sharing’ genes: they take up DNA from their environment and from other bacteria. It is known that the rate that bacteria exchange DNA increases with their population size (ie. there seems to be an evolutionary advantage to sharing DNA when the population is successful). But how can bacteria ‘tell’ how many other bacteria are present? The bacterium Pneumococcus continually makes a 17-amino acid signalling peptide. The bacterial cells also possess a receptor for this peptide Communication in Bacterial Cells Low cell density At low population density, the concentration of the signaling peptide is too low to bind to the receptors and stimulate DNA uptake. Receptor Bacterial cell Signaling molecule Communication in Bacterial Cells High cell density At high population density, the concentration of the signaling peptide is high enough to bind to the receptors and stimulate DNA uptake. DNA molecule Is anybody out there?? Microbial community This is an example of ‘quorum sensing’ A process by which bacteria can tell how many cells are in a given space In this case, each cell is both a signalling and a responding cell but the basic four component pattern remains the same. Controls many behaviours of bacteria Eg. light emission, toxin production https://www.ted.com/talks/bonnie_bassler_on_how_bacteria_communicate#t-170029 Watch this excellent TED-talk on ‘How bacteria talk’ (18 min). Focus on the way bioluminescence is controlled by a quorum response (from 2’ 45” to 8’) So far we have talked about inter-cellular communication What happens in the responding cell after the signalling molecule becomes linked to the receptor?
