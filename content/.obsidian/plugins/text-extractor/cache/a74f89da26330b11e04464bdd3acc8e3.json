Ironside Contents • DNA structure • DNA replication in vivo • DNA replication in vitro (PCR) • Uses of PCR Properties of genetic material • Must store complex information – Must code for all traits and functions of organism – Must mutate occasionally • To produce variation – Must be relatively stable • Must replicate faithfully – Every organism must undergo billions of cell divisions • Must be translated into protein to produce phenotype Nucleotides • Building blocks of DNA polymer • Three parts – Deoxyribose • Pentose sugar – Five carbon atoms labelled 1', 2',3', 4' and 5' – Nitrogenous base • Forms glycosidic bond with 1' carbon of deoxyribose • Purine – Six-sided ring attached to five-sided ring » Adenine (A) and guanine (G) • Pyramidine – Six-sided ring » Cytosine (C) and thymine (T) – Phosphate group • Forms ester bond with 5' carbon of deoxyribose • Carries negative charge – Causes DNA to migrate in electrical field Polynucleotide strands • Phosphodiester linkages – Link • 5'-phosphate group of one nucleotide • 3'-carbon of next nucleotide • Polynucleotide strand – Backbone of alternating sugars and phosphates – 5' end • Has free phosphate group – Attached to 5' carbon of sugar – 3' end • Has free OH group – attached to 3' carbon of sugar 3D structure of DNA • Double helix – Two polynucleotide strands • wound around one another • Bases – stacked in centre • Hydrogen bonds – Link bases on opposite strands • A-T (2 bonds) • C-G (3 bonds) • Strands are complementary – Where one has C, the other has G, etc. • Denaturation temperature – At which strands separate • Depends on ratio of AT:CG Semi-conservative replication Accuracy of DNA replication • Development of a multicellular organism • Requires millions of cell divisions • Every division has the potential for DNA copying errors • DNA replication must be very accurate Speed of DNA replication • Eukaryotic chromosomes – Linear – Contain a huge amount of DNA • Typically 100 million base pairs in humans • Rate of DNA replication – 500-5000 nucleotides per minute • Would require 7 days to replicate a single chromosome • Multiple origins of replication – Allow DNA to be replicated in smaller units (replicons) • 20-300 thousand base pairs long – Can replicate entire genome in minutes Replication bubbles • At each origin of replication – DNA unwinds • Forms replication bubble • DNA synthesis – Occurs on both strands in both directions • Replication forks – Points at which DNA strands separate • proceed outwards – Bubbles run into one another and merge dNTPs • Deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) – Raw materials for DNA synthesis – Consist of • Deoxyribose sugar • Base (A, T, C or G) • Three phosphate groups – Added to 3' OH group of new DNA strand • Removes two phosphate groups • Forms phosphodiester bond Direction of replication • DNA polymerase enzyme – Adds nucleotides to the 3' end of the growing strand • DNA synthesis proceeds 5'→3' • Strands of double helix are antiparallel – Run in opposite directions • Leading strand – Direction of DNA synthesis is the same as DNA replication • Continuously replicated • Lagging strand – Direction of DNA synthesis is opposite direction of DNA replication • Discontinuously replicated – Produces Okazaki fragments » 100-200 nucleotides long Primers • DNA polymerase – Can only add nucleotides to existing strand • Cannot begin new strand • Primers – Short strands of complementary RNA • Single stranded – 30-40 nucleotides long – Anneal to unwound DNA strand • At 3' end – Initiate synthesis of DNA Replication of chromosome ends • Primers – Composed of RNA • Lack 3'-OH group – Removed after replication • Replaced by extension of adjacent fragment • Terminal fragments – Have no adjacent fragments • Leaves gap where primer is removed – Chromosome is shortened every time it is replicated Telomeres • Telomeres – Occur at ends of chromosome – Consist of repeated DNA sequences • Telomerase – Extends telomeres • Does not require template – Maintains length of chromosome – Active in early embryonic cells – Can undergo unlimited cell divisions – Inactive in most adult somatic cells • can undergo only a limited number of cell divisions • Hayflick Limit • Cell ceases dividing when this is reached PCR • DNA replication in the laboratory • Used to make many copies of a specific DNA sequence • Crucial to many forms of genetic analysis • Population genetics • Forensics • Diagnostic screening • Analysis of ancient DNA Separation of DNA strands • In the cell • Performed by enzyme DNA helicase • In PCR • Performed by raising temperature to 94-95°C Primers • Synthesis of new DNA strand • Initiated by binding of primer to template strand • In cell and PCR • Forward PCR primer • Synthetic oligonucleotide • Designed to match beginning of selected DNA sequence on one strand • Reverse PCR primer • Designed to match end of selected DNA sequence on one strand • Primer design • Flanking sequences must be known • Forward and reverse primers • must have similar annealing temperatures • Must not match each other • Or primer dimers will form Polymerases for PCR • E. coli polymerase – From bacterium Escherichia coli – Denatures at 90°C • Must be added afresh to each PCR cycle – Slows down process • Taq polymerase – From bacterium Thermus aquaticus • Discovered in boiling springs of Yellowstone National Park – Stable at 95°C » Only needs to be added once, at beginning of reaction – High speed – Low fidelity • Pfu polymerase – From archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus • Discovered in hydrothermal vents – thermostable – Slower than Taq – Has proofreading activity » Higher fidelity • Taq and Pfu – Can be combined in a single PCR reaction • Combines speed of Taq with fidelity of Pfu The PCR cycle • Thermal cycler (PCR machine) • Programable heat block • PCR cycle • Strand separation 95°C • Primer annealing • DNA synthesis 72°C • Exponential process • 20-40 cycles • Produces millions of copies • Of the sequence between the primers PCR Species-specific PCR • Primers • Designed to match variable DNA sequence • Differs between species • Consistent within a species • PCR • Will only amplify DNA from the species of interest • Used for • Diagnosing disease • Detecting presence of a species in environmental samples • Invasive non-native species • Species of conservation importance Andersen et al. 2020 Diagnostic PCR • Species-specific PCR • used to diagnose infectious pathogens • Influenza • COVID-19 • Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) • Chlamydia trachomatis • viral hepatitis • Human Papillomavirus (HPV) • In individual humans • In the blood supply","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":""}
