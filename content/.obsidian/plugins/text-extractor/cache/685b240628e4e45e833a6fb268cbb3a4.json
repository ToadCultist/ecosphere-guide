P=0.01574 (Significant diff) The lower the P value the more significant the difference the labs Threshold is P<0.050 for biologists (ie. 5% chance of being wrong) P=0.0174 (Significant diff. ie. less than 0.05) ANOVA -Analysis of Variance One-way ANOVA (easier/better than t-test) Hypothesis: there is a difference in the number of propagules that grew the three labs NULL hypothesis: there is no difference..... P=0.0174 (Significant difference) The lower the P value the more significant the difference the labs Threshold is P<0.05 for biologists (ie. 5% chance of being wrong) Tukey’s test shows which treatments are sig. diff.
