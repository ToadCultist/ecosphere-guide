Miles Joseph Berkeley (1803-1869) Anton de Bary (1831-1888) SYMBIOSIS (De Bary) Mutualism +/+ Neutralism 0/0 Parasitism +/- OUTCOME vs MECHANISM Cost / benefit analysis - Variable/Hard to measure Mutualism vs Competition Cost / benefit analysis EAT Bury + Recover +/- Bury + Forget  Acorns germinate 0/+ Smelly Cuckoos =parasites or mutualists? Canestrari et al. (2014), Science, 21st Mch, v343, pp1350-1353 Cuckoo chick secretions deter predators of crow chicks Mutual benefit is obvious for LICHEN symbiosis Ascomycete apothecia BUT for some fungi/ bacteria inhabiting plant roots the situation is less clear Mycorrhizas Final Step in Nutrient Cycle ‘Close the loop’ = Fungus Root DECOMPOSER SUBSYSTEM PLANT SUBSYSTEM >75% of plant species are mycorrhizal Mycorrhizas Why Mycorrhizas? 1. Surface area (SA) : Volume ratio Roots (>30m diam); Hyphae (2-10m diam) >10x greater SA per unit biomass (halving the cell diameter doubles the SA/Vol ratio) 2. Exoenzymes Access to diverse nutrient sources 3. Plant growth not limited by carbon Exchange C for nutrients FUNGUS PLANT N, P, water C sucrosetrehalose Efficient “haustorial” transfer interface Use of radiolabels MASS FLOW Higher C demand Higher N,P demand Up to 30% of ‘root’ biomass is fungal Structure Intracellular? Main nutrients Hosts Fungal symbiont ECTO (sheathing) AMF Ericoid MYCORRHIZAL TYPES Glomero- mycota Basidio- mycota Asco- mycota Arbuscules Coils AMF Ecto Ericoid Ectomycorrhizas Only colonise outer root tissues (sheathing mycorrhizas) Cause change in root morphology Infect many tree /shrub species Fungi involved are mainly basidiomycetesSheath Hartig net Species-specific ectomycorrhizal morphology e.g. Amanita muscaria phylum Glomeromycota (e.g. Glomus) Ancient (400 MY) Obligate biotrophs / Wide host range Form intracellular arbuscules Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF) arbuscules inside host cell spores found in soil Vesicles (storage) Appressorium (entry) Arbuscules (feeding) AMF mycelium extends into soil (spores formed here) Some species for lipid vesicles inside roots formerly called VAM (vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizas) ERICACEOUS MYCORRHIZAS e.g. Hymenoscyphus Coils are short-lived (3-4 wks) 1mm Eric AMF Ecto Herbivores need access to lignocellulose energy Cellulolytic GUT MICROBES -Bacteria / Protozoans / Rumen fungi Most animals have mutualistic associations with microbes Fungus Farming = Inside -out guts Termites are major agents of wood decay in tropics Can cycle up to 25% NPP in savannah ecosystems Old World termites (Macrotermitinae) have species- specific Termitomyces ‘Fungus Gardens’ (Agaric) New World termites have protist gut symbionts, Hence their larger body size Termites AcanthotermesMacrotermes Anoplotermes Macrotermes Tall earth nests (= fermenters) Termitomyces titanicus (2.5kg mushrooms) Termites collect and chew wood pulp to feed the fungal ‘comb’ Termitomyces forms swollen hyphae which are eaten by the termites Termitomyces and Old World Termites Fungal enzymes continue to act in the termite gut Termitomyces titanicus Convective Cooling Evolution of 'tasty' swollen hyphae Ambrosia Beetle Termites Ants Fungus-farming ants Attine ants (New World) and AttamycesThe ants carry Streptomyces bacteria Escovopsis Ascomycete parasite of the fungus garden Specific antibiotic to kill pathogen Promotes Attamyces growth ATTINE ants + Attamyces fungus END","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
