Governmental organisations • Financed (at least in part) from government budget Funding sources for non- governmental organisations (NGOs) • Unrestricted funding • Generated by conservation organisations • No restrictions on use • Grant funding • From governments, foundations, etc. • For specified purposes • Released funding • Through tax breaks, etc. Core vs operational costs • Funders • Wish to see their money spent directly on conservation activities • Prefer core costs to be minimised • Charity rating organisations • Use ratio of core to operational costs as key performance indicator (KPI) • NGOs • Seek to maximise unrestricted funds • Succeed in unrestricted fundraising • Charge maximum overheads and management fees to grants and contracts • Seek to minimise perceived core costs • Package administrative activities with conservation activities • Charge time of core staff to projects Unrestricted funds • Raised through • Donations • Membership fees • Retail activities • Legacies • Endowments • Gifts of money where only interest can be spent • Used to pay for core costs • Salaries and overheads • For staff not funded through grants • E.g. senior managers, fund-raisers • Office costs Membership • Specialist organisations • Low membership numbers (<5,000) • Low costs of servicing members • Can be done by volunteers • Mass membership • Higher costs • Staff, databases, communications technology • Requires activities to attract members • Magazines, conferences, participation in campaigns, etc. • Costly • May be supported by advertising • Only if membership numbers are very high (hundreds of thousands) • Identify areas with many potential members • Through analysis of postcode data Restricted funds • Grant funding • Raised under contract or agreement • Must be spent on specific things • Usually operational costs for specific conservation projects Question • Who should conservationists take money from? Sources of restricted funds • Foundations • Established by wealthy individuals • Governments • Bilateral funding • Government in one country funds NGO in another • Multilateral funding • Many governments contribute to a fund • Private sector • Can be controversial • E.g. Friends of the Earth will not accept corporate funding Overheads • Cost of supporting the work • In addition to actually doing it • E.g. office costs, HR costs • Funders may provide overheads • As a % of direct project costs • Indirect cost recovery agreement • As a % of salary costs • Creates an incentive to inflate salaries Match funding • Donor requires that their funding is ‘matched’ by funding from other sources • From the applicant’s core budget • With funding obtained from other donors • May be cash or ‘in kind’ donations of goods or services • Challenge funds • Donor offers large fund which must be matched • Encourages other donors to give • E.g. Robert W. Wilson • Offered challenge fund of US$20M to Wildlife Conservation Society • Amount received each year depended on match funding raised ‘Debt for Nature’ swaps • Many countries have high national debts • Debt is traded internationally at values below face value • Can be bought by conservation organisations • Can be given back to debtor country in exchange for conservation agreement • Exchange can occur directly between two governments • Facilitated by conservation NGO • E.g. USA forgave $26 Million of debt owed by Costa Rica • Costa Rica agreed to spend the same amount on forest conservation Trading in biodiversity units • Biodiversity net gain (BNG) legislation • Introduced in the UK in 2021 • Developers • Must produce at least 10% net gain in biodiversity • Where BNG cannot be achieved on development site • It must be offset in offsite habitats • Where excess BNG is achieved • BNG units can be sold on the open market","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
