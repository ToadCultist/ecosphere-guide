Lineus longissiumus ✓ Platyhelminths and Nemerteans often ciliated ✓ Move by ciliary action (creeping) ✓ Facilitated by body muscle contractions ✓ Mostly aquatic and use copious mucus in some cases! HYDROSTATIC SKELETONS ✓ Soft bodied animals (worms etc) ✓ Longitudinal and circular muscles operate against incompressible fluids ✓ Generally, create movement via waves of body flexion HYDROSTATIC SKELETONS ✓ Longitudinal contractions ✓ Pedal locomotory waves ✓ Monotaxic ✓ Ditaxic Direct Retrograde PEDAL WAVES Direct Retrograde Lai et al (2010) PERISTALTIC MOVEMENT ✓ Flatworms and some annelids ✓ Alternating waves of longitudinal and circular muscle groups ✓ Fixed coelomic volume (shunting of fluid) ERRANT POLYCHAETES ✓ Parapodia move (backwards) to propel against substrate ✓ Metachronal wave ✓ Fast crawling enhanced by body waves with parapodia on power-stroke at crest SLOW FAST ECHINODERMS ✓ Unique radial water vascular system ✓ Radial canal and ampullae supply tube feet ✓ Hydrostatic pressure extends foot ✓ Longitudinal muscles retract foot ✓ Many are suckered Espen Rekdal CC-BY-2.0","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
