Invertebrates, fourth edition. Oxford University Press • RRP £129. The Invertebrates • What are invertebrates… …and how did they come into existence? • Dictionary definition… “Any animal lacking a spinal column or backbone….including all species which are not defined as vertebrates”… ….They lack bones… • Etymology: Latin in- without and vertebra a joint (in the spinal column of vertebrates). The Invertebrates • 2-2.7 billion years ago…α-proteobacterium was ingested by a prokaryote to form a eukaryotic cell. • This primary endosymbiotic event gave rise to the modern day eukaryotic lineage. • From the Eukaryota evolved the following kingdoms: Protista, Metazoa, Fungi and Plantae…. The Invertebrate Protozoa • BUT the metazoan lineage evolved from protozoa… • What are Protozoa… Brusca, Moore & Shuster (2016)…Protozoa are eukaryotic largely unicellular organisms that do no undergo tissue formation through the process of embryological layering. …and how did they come into existence? • The transition from single celled protists to multicellular metazoans… …the evolution of multicellularity. The Invertebrate Protozoa • Protozoa from Latin proto- first and Greek zōia animals. • (predominantly) Unicellular eukaryotes. • Paraphyletic • Extremely important! • Includes: choanoflagellates, dinoflagellates, apicomplexa, haptophytes, euglenids etc. The Evolution of Multicellularity • The transition from a single celled to multicelled organism….  Symbiotic theory – different protozoa joining together as symbionts  Colonial theory – asexual reproduction of cells that remained together.  Cellularisation – multinucleate protist evolving cell membranes around its nuclei. …most likely is colonial theory. The Evolution of Multicellularity • Not quite this simple.… • A significant step was the differentiation among cells…. • Disadvantage: irreversible….cells less well adapted for survival and multiplication on their own. The Evolution of Multicellularity • Hollow ball of cells (blastea) to a invaginated multi- layered embryo to generate the “germ cell layers”. • Germ cell layer is primary layer of cells that forms during development which gives rise to tissues and organs etc. Gastrulation • Following initial cell division a blastula forms. • Multilayered embryo called a gastrula. • The identification of two or three germ cell layers. Gastrulation • Embryonic cell layers:  Ectoderm – outer layer of cells. Forms the epithelium etc.  Endoderm – inner layer of cells. Forms the lining of the gut etc.  Mesoderm – middle layer of cells. Only present in triploblastic organisms. Forms the muscles etc. • Common to the metazoans. • Six significant evolutionary steps that occurred during the evolution of the metazoa (Nielsen, 2008) The Invertebrates • Etymology: Latin meta- change and Greek zōia animals. • They are divided into approx. 32 phyla. • Phylogeny reconstructed using genetics and morphological characteristics. Invertebrate Body Plan • Invertebrates are groups according to body symmetry: • Asymmetrical (Non-Bilateria). ? (Radially symmetrical; Non-Bilateria). • Bilaterally symmetrical.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
