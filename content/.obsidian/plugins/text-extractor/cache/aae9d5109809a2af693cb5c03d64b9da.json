(a) Narrow niches with little overlap (d >w), i.e. relatively little interspecific competition. (b) Broader niches with greater overlap (d < w), i.e. relatively intense interspecific competition. Resource Utilisation Curves Feeding positions of five species of warblers in the coniferous forest of the north-eastern United States. Zones of most concentrated feeding activity are shaded. B = base of branches; M = middle of branches; T = terminal portions of branches. Resource utilisation Barnacles Cthamalus and Balanus have zonation in their distribution They have realised niches as there is a degree of competition present Both intraspecific and interspecific competition are present Realised niches Competitive release: Niche expansion in response to reduced interspecific competition Chalcophaps indica (vertical bars) Chalcophaps stephani (solid shading) Gallicollumba rufigula (diagonal bars) Competitive release Newly aggregated mobile sand dune, with isolated fragments of sea-lyme grass & couch grass www.sandsoftime.hope.ac.uk Specialised & changeable niches Also both altitudinal & latitudinal limits to many nichesAlso both altitudinal & latitudinal limits to many niches Limits to niches Positions of trees as described by the terms Limits to niches • Ecotone: transition between two structurally different communities • Krummholz: where stunted trees are found in an Alpine transition zone Adaptation Achillea lanulosa plants showed phenotypic variation, where the environment imposed certain constraints and made the plants grow in a certain manner Phenotypic variation • Phenotype: physical expression of a characteristic of an organism, determined by both genetic constitution and environment Differences in size are retained even if grown in an experimental garden under standard conditions Achillea lanulosa plants in the Sierra Nevada: Size varies with altitude The Northern polar region contains very cryptic small plant species, sometimes dwarf versions Phenotypic variation Monocormic – trees with a single dominant axis of growth Birch trees in the south of Sweden: they have a single, dominant trunk Differences in morphology of birch trees Polycormic – multi-branched trees In the North: birch trees multi-branched due to harsh environment Differences in morphology of birch trees In addition to the differences in morphology, there are physiological and biochemical differences that are not obvious to the human eye… Resistance to drought Inland populations are generally more drought-tolerant as the areas are often drier Differences in drought tolerance between coastal and inland plant populations.

Summary • ‘Fundamental niche’: total range of environmental conditions a species can survive • ‘Realised niche’: the final niche after reduction of the fundamental niche by competition • ‘Resource utilisation curves’ are the unidimensional pattern of use for one resource by a single species • Where resource utilisation curves overlap for different species for a single resource, competition occurs. Can be shown graphically Summary • ‘Competitive release’ is when one species expands its niche in response to a reduction in competition • Altitude and latitude often limit niches in space • Single genotypes exhibit different phenotypes in different environments References and acknowledgements: • Kruuk, H.
