Law of segregation • Every individual organism contains two alleles for each trait • These alleles segregate (separate) during meiosis • Each gamete contains only one of the alleles. Alleles • Different versions of the same gene • May produce different phenotypes Biparental inheritance • Diploid individual – Contains two copies of each gene • One from each parent • Homozygous individual – Contains two identical copies • Heterozygous individual – Contains two different copies Genotypes and phenotypes • Genotype – Alleles of a particular gene or genes • present in a particular individual • Phenotype – Expression of the genotype • Morphology • Biochemistry • Behaviour Genotype: Mutation of Melanocortin 1 receptor Phenotype: Red hair, freckles, etc. Exceptions • Prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) • Clonal reproduction • Haploid organisms • Sex chromosomes Independent assortment • Gamete – Haploid – Contains one copy of each parental gene • Determined at random • Zygote – diploid • Formed by fusion of two gametes – From same or different individuals – Develops into diploid individual 2. Law of Independent Assortment • Alleles for separate traits are passed independently of one another from parents to offspring. Exceptions • Clonal reproduction • Entire genome is inherited • Genes on the same chromosome • More likely to be inherited together • linkage 3. Law of dominance • Recessive alleles will always be masked by dominant alleles • Complete dominance – Phenotype of recessive allele • Only expressed when homozygous – Phenotype of heterozygote = phenotype of dominant homozygote • A1A2= A1A1 Exceptions • Incomplete dominance – Phenotype of heterozygote • Is intermediate between two homozygotes • Codominance – Phenotype of heterozygote • Contains traits of both alleles Agouti cat coat colour gene • Alleles • A expressed as tabby phenotype • Greybrown base colour with dark markings • a expressed as solid colour phenotype • markings are not usually visible aa AA Probability • If• Probability of event 1 happening is x • Probability of event 2 happening is y • Then • Probability of both events happening is xy • Probability of either event happening is x+y Coat colour: monohybrid cross X F1 Complete dominance aa AA Aa Monohybrid cross • Second cross • between two individuals • from F1 generation X ?
