LGI = Lateral giant interneurons. FF = Fast flexors. MoG = Motor giant. SG = segmental giant Action patterns: Central Pattern Generators -Sequence of effector actions patterned in space & time -Rhythm generated in ganglion, but central control & peripheral input Distributed hierarchical control Brain & spinal control Efferent pathways • Somatic division • Organisation • Reflex and fixed acts • Action patterns • Autonomic division • Organisation • Autonomic tone 17 Rest & digest Flight or fight ACh ACh ACh NA (Sympathetic trunk ganglion) (Terminal ganglion) Autonomic division: organisation Parasympathetic Sympathetic Neurotransmitters ACh & ACh ACh & noradrenaline Ganglia Terminal Sympathetic trunk Nerves arise from… Craniosacral spinal cord Thoracolumbar spinal cord Autonomic tone, tonic stimulation Organ (selected examples only) Sympathetic stimulation Parasympathetic stimulation Heart Increased rate, increased force Decreased rate, decreased force Blood vessels Constriction Dilation (vessels supplying penis/clitoris) Lungs Dilation of bronchioles Constriction of bronchioles Eye Dilation of pupil Constriction of pupil Adrenal medulla Stimulation None Digestive tract Decreased motility, contraction of sphincters, inhibition of digestive secretions Increased motility, relaxation of sphincters, stimulation of digestive secretions Urinary bladder Relaxation Contraction (emptying) Neurotransmitter receptors are key • There are two types of ACh receptor: nicotinic and muscarinic • All autonomic ganglia have nicotinic receptors • Muscarinic receptors are found in parasympathetic targets • Atropine blocks muscarinic receptors: selective effect of parasympathetic stimulation (used to suppress salivary and bronchial secretions pre-surgery) • There are multiple adrenergic receptors: alpha and beta types Efferent pathways • Somatic division • Organisation • Reflex and fixed acts • Action patterns • Autonomic division • Organisation • Autonomic tone","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
