Population genetics If we know the population composition in one generation, what will they be in the next generation? Mating Offspring Offspring survival One generation Terminology Alleles: different forms of the same gene (A and a) • Gene frequency: proportion each gene/allele in the population Genotype: genetic combination of alleles found at a given locus • Homozygous dominant: AA • Heterozygous: Aa • Homozygous recessive: aa • Genotype frequency: proportion of individuals with each genotype Phenotype: physical trait from given genotype that can be observed in some way Genes and genotypesHardy-Weinberg principle Allele and genotype frequencies in a population will not change from generation to generation when no evolutionary forces are applied. GH Hardy & W Weinberg Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium In the absence of evolution – Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Assumptions of Hardy-Weinberg: 1. No mutation 2. Random mating 3. No gene flow (in or out) 4. Very large population size 5. No natural selection If any assumption is not met – no equilibrium. Where does the Hardy- Weinberg equilibrium come from? A a A a p q p q pp pq pq qq pp + pq +pq + qq = p2 + 2pq + q2 Hardy-Weinberg equations Genotype frequency: the proportion of individuals with each genotype Genotype: AA Aa aa Frequency: P Q R H-W: p2 2pq q2 Must add up to 1 (or 100%) Gene frequency: the proportion each allele in the population Allele: A a Frequency: p q p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1 p + q = 1 Calculating observed genotype frequencies In a population of 8 individuals, 3 are AA, 3 are Aa and 2 are aa. Calculate the genotype frequencies. P: Frequency of AA = 3/8 = 0.375 Q: Frequency of Aa = 3/8 = 0.375 R: Frequency of aa = 2/8 = 0.25 Check answer by summing the frequencies (should equal 1): P + Q + R = 1 0.375 + 0.375 + 0.25 = 1 𝑃 = # ℎ𝑜𝑚𝑜𝑧𝑦𝑔𝑜𝑢𝑠 𝑑𝑜𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑛𝑡 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑄 = # ℎ𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑜𝑧𝑦𝑔𝑜𝑢𝑠 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑅 = # ℎ𝑜𝑚𝑜𝑧𝑦𝑔𝑜𝑢𝑠 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑣𝑒 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 Test yourself: genotype frequencies In the country of Genovia, the population is 50,000. If 16,000 people are homozygous dominant for brown hair and 28,000 people are heterozygous, calculate the genotype frequencies. Even though you aren’t given the recessive count – you can calculate it! 50,000 – 16,000 – 28,000 = 6,000 P: Frequency of BB = 16,000/50,000 = 0.32 Q: Frequency of Bb = 28,000/50,000 = 0.56 R: Frequency of bb = 6,000/50,000 = 0.12 0.32 + 0.56 + 0.12 = 1 Calculating observed allele frequencies Each genotype contains two alleles. The total number of genes in a population is its gene pool. In the same population of 8 individuals (3 are AA, 3 are Aa and 2 are aa) calculate the gene frequency. AA, AA, AA, Aa, Aa, Aa, aa, aa p: Frequency of A = 9/16 = 0.5625 q: Frequency of a = 7/16 = 0.4375 Check answer by summing the frequencies (should equal 1): p + q = 1 0.5625 + 0.4375 = 1 𝑝 = # 𝑜𝑓 𝑑𝑜𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑛𝑎𝑡 𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑠 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑒 𝑝𝑜𝑜𝑙 𝑞 = # 𝑜𝑓 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑣𝑒 𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑠 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑒 𝑝𝑜𝑜𝑙 Test yourself: observed allele frequencies In the same population of 70 individuals, 44 are AA, 21 are Aa and 5 are aa. Calculate the allele frequencies. 𝑝 = 2 × 44 + (1 × 21) (2 × 70) = 109 140 = 0.779 𝑞 = 2 × 5 + (1 × 21) (2 × 70) = 31 140 = 0.221 0.779 + 0.221 = 1 Allele frequencies from genotype frequencies p = P + ½Q q = R + ½Q In a population, 40% are AA, 30% are Aa and 30% are aa. Calculate the allele frequencies. p = P + ½Q p = 0.4 + ½(0.3) p = 0.4 + 0.15 = 0.55 q = R + ½Q q = 0.3 + ½(0.3) p = 0.3 + 0.15 = 0.45 Check answer by summing the frequencies (should equal 1): p + q = 1 0.55 + 0.45 = 1 Allele frequencies can be calculated from genotype frequencies. Test yourself: observed alleles frequencies In a population, 29% are AA, 58% are Aa and 13% are aa. Calculate the gene frequencies. p = P + ½Q p = 0.29 + ½(0.58) p = 0.29 + 0.29 = 0.58 q = R + ½Q q = 0.13 + ½(0.58) p = 0.13 + 0.29 = 0.42 0.58 + 0.42 = 1 How does it work? An example Quick summary… 1. If you know genotype counts, you can calculate genotype and allele frequencies with count/total and alleles/total gene pool 2. If you know genotype frequencies, you can calculate allele frequencies with p = P + ½Q and q = R + ½Q 3. If you know allele frequencies, you can predict genotype frequencies with p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1 4. You need to know homozygous recessive information or at least two other bits of data/information Putting Hardy Weinberg to work Assume 3 in every 1234 people in a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium population are afflicted with the recessive disease m. This means that the afflicted have a homozygous recessive genotype (R = q2 when it comes to alleles). Turn to a frequency / q2 = 3/1234 = .002431 We can calculate the allele/gene frequency q = Sqrt 0.002431 = .049306 p = 1 - q = 1 - .049306 = .950694 Frequency for heterozygous carrier = 2pq = 2(.049306)(.950694) = .093750 The number of people that are carriers is 0.09375 x 1234 = 115.68 people Calculating expected genotype frequencies What if the question asks you to calculate all the expected genotype frequencies? Calculate q by finding the square root of the frequency. Then use p + q = 1 and p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1 to solve for the expected genotype frequencies. Example: 7% of individuals in a population display the recessive phenotype. Calculate the expected genotype frequencies. q2 = 0.07 so q = 0.265 p + q = 1 so p = 1 – q = 1 – 0.265 = 0.735 1) Calculate the genotype frequencies from count data 2) Calculate the observed gene frequencies 3) Use Hardy-Weinberg (p2 + 2pq + q2) to get the expected genotype frequencies 4) Calculate the expected counts • If observed = expected, the population is in Hardy- Weinberg equilibrium • If observed ≠ expected, the population is not in Hardy- Weinberg equilibrium Is my population under selection? Using Hardy-Weinberg Crib sheet! Is my population under selection?: Using Hardy-Weinberg Without evolution, populations are in a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium – no changes in gene or genotype frequencies over generations. Testing the Next generation… Expected frequencies = will the real frequencies match this? Calculating expected allele frequencies Calculate q by finding the square root of the frequency. 𝑞 = 𝑞2 Given a homozygous recessive genotype frequency, q2… Example: 7% of individuals in a population display the recessive phenotype. Calculate the recessive allele frequency. 7% 𝑜𝑟 0.07 = 𝑞2 𝑞 = 𝑞2 = 0.07 = 0.265 𝑝2 + 2𝑝𝑞 + 𝑞2 = 1 Homozygous recessive genotype frequency **Calculations should always start with the recessive genotype/allele.** Calculating expected genotype frequencies Example: 7% of individuals in a population display the recessive phenotype. Calculate the expected genotype frequencies. p = 0.735 and q = 0.265 𝑝2 + 2𝑝𝑞 + 𝑞2 = 1 Homozygous recessive genotype frequency Homozygous dominant genotype frequency Heterozygous genotype frequency p2 = 0.7352 = 0.540 or 54% 2pq = (2)(0.735)(0.265) = 0.390 or 39% q2 = 0.2652 = 0.07 or 7% Let's test this approach with some examples Blood Groups : Lm Ln Population LmLm LmLn LnLn Total Freq.

African American LmLm = p2 = 79/ 278 = 0.284 p = 0.284 = 0.533 q = 1-p , q = 1-0.533 = 0.468 therefore = q2 (LnLn) should be (0.468)2 = 0.219 2pq = 2 x 0.533 x 0.468 = 0. 499 Expected number is frequency x n = ; e.g. 2pqn = 0.499 x 278 = 138.7 Jaeken syndrome (also known as carbohydrate- deficient-glycoprotein syndrome) is a serious human genetic disorder inherited recessive disease Patients with Jaeken syndrome suffer from skeletal deformities, inadequate liver function and an abnormal distribution of subcutaneous fat. About 20% of sufferers die before age 5. Mutations in the PMM2 gene, which encodes an enzyme involved in glycoprotein synthesis, called phosphomannomutase. People with Jaeken syndrome are all homozygous in the sense that they carry 2 mutant alleles for gene PMM2. PMM2 Mutations Arginine to Histidine Jaeken syndrome Among 54 patients the most frequent allele was R141H. The frequency of R141H we will denote as “q”, the frequency of the other alleles we will denote as “p”. The following genotype frequencies were observed among the patients: 0/54 had genotype R141H/ R141H = R 11/54 had genotypes other/other = P The rest were heterozygous for R141H, having genotypes R141H/other What is the frequency of the each of the 3 genotypes? other/other: 0.2037 (11/54) R R141H/ R141H: 0 R141H/other: 0.7963 (43/54) P Q Jaeken syndrome To work out if this population is under selection we need to work out p and q. This will allow us to derive a population if no selection was occurring. We can work is out from P which is p2. p= 𝑝2 p = 0.20372 p= 0.4513 , therefore q = 1-p = 0.5487 What are the expected frequencies of the three genotypes if the alleles are in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium? R = R141H/ R141H: q2= 0.5487 2 = 0.301 x 54 = 16.75 P = other/ other: p2= 0.45132 = 0.204 x 54 = 11.02 Q = R141H/ other: 2pq= 2 x 0.4513 x 0.5487 = 0.495 x 54 = 26.73 Chi-square test Used to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between expected values and observed values.
