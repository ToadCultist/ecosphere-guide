{"path":"University/Lecture slides/Module archive/Ecology and Conservation/Predator prey interactions.pdf","text":"Predator-prey relationships Objectives By the end of this lecture, you should understand: • The ‘Lotka-Volterra model’ of ‘predator-prey relationships’ • Gause’s studies of protozoans • Huffaker’s ‘orange universe’ studies of mites • An understanding of ‘predator responses’ (‘numerical’ and ‘functional’) • Predator and prey strategies, e.g. camouflage in prey species, to minimise predation The church funded by the Hudson Bay company in Canada. This company has become ecologically significant as the data they were believed to have confirmed the work of two key 1920s ecologists, Lotka and Volterra. Canada Lynx Canada Lynx (Lynx candensis) northwestconnections.org Lynx – Hare cycles Lynx populations are estimated from the number of lynx furs traded. Both hares and lynx oscillate in numbers in a 9-10 year cycle. This is interpreted as an intrinsic predator-prey cycle. ultranet.com Lotka and Volterra Prey densityPredator density kettering.edu Lotka and Volterra IIExperiments with protozoans Predator prey interactions between the protozoan: Paramecium caudatum (● prey) Didinium nasutum (○ predator) Combinations: (a) No refuge. (b) with a refuge. (c) with immigration every third day. Contradicts Lotka-Volterra model Huffaker’s ‘Orange Universe’ He studied a system using the phytophagous mite Eotetranychus (prey) and another mite Typhlodromus (predator) Huffaker (1958) believed that the system was too simple. Huffaker’s ‘Orange Universe’ System relies on emigration, and immigration and environmental heterogeneity tiem.utk.edu Huffaker’s ‘Orange Universe’ Azuki bean weevil, Callosobruchus chinensis - Host Heterospilus prosopidis - Parasitoid Host - Parasitoid relationships Various patterns of predator-prey abundance. Tawny owls (Strix aluco) near Oxford maintain a constancy of abundance despite fluctuations in the numbers of their small mammal prey. Tawny Owls Wood mice and bank voles Tawny owlsMice per acreNo. owl pairs Numerical responses of the shrews Sorex and Blarina and the deer mouse Peromyscus to changes in abundance of the European pine sawfly Two possible ways in which predators can respond to an increase in prey population density: 1) Numerical response - density of the predators increases 2) A functional response - consumption of prey increases (after Holling 1959) Predator Responses - Numerical Fuctional responses of the shrews Sorex and Blarina and the deer mouse Peromyscus to changes in abundance of the European pine sawfly. (after Holling 1959) Predator Responses - FunctionalWildlife’s 10 Year Cycle Fluctuations in relative biomass of the major components of ‘Wildlife’s 10 year cycle’ in Alberta, Canada. Arrows indicate the major causative influences • Cycles exist in hare populations, and are tracked by a number of predators, including Canada lynx • There are also 10 year cycles of other herbivores, e.g. the Ruffed grouse Keith (1983) How to avoid predation Consumers How to avoid predation 1. Using camouflage, the ‘twig caterpillar’ resembles a branch users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet 2. The skunk is famous for releasing a nasty odorous discharge and uses chemical defence. How to avoid predation 3. Warning colouration • Advertises noxiousness and warns predators • Birds will not eat such brightly coloured butterflies Monarch butterfly How to avoid predation 4. Mimicry – Batesian • Species have evolved to look like noxious prey in order to deter predators How to avoid predation 5. Mimicry - Müllerian • Species have evolved to look like noxious prey in order to deter predators How to avoid predation 6. Behaviour • Animals cooperate and form social groups. They interact and use social structures to reduce the impact of predation. How to avoid predation Predator Behaviour • Animals cooperate and form social groups to prey on other animals How to increase predation Angler fish is famous for luring other fish towards itself. It uses a lure that looks like a small fish From - Wikipedia How to increase predation Summary • Lotka & Volterra model: cyclical pattern of predator & prey numbers • Gause, working on protozoans, concluded this was a property of interference in the system & not of system itself • Huffaker, working on mites, believed Gause’s system was too simple, & demonstrated stable cycling with a spatially heterogeneous microcosm • Predators have both numerical (change in number of predators) and functional (change in predation habits) responses to changes in prey numbers • Both prey and predators evolve mechanisms to increase their chance of catching prey / avoiding predation References and acknowledgements: • Kruuk, H.
