Society for the Preservation of the Wild Fauna and Flora of the Empire (SPWFE) • Established nature reserves and changed hunting culture • Saved African megafauna • Still active as Fauna and Flora International Societies that employed professionals • To promote new legislation • E.g. Footpaths and Commons Preservation Society • Rescued Hampstead Heath (London) from development • Promoted urban green space in city planning worldwide • To acquire land • E.g. National Trust • Now UK’s second largest landowner (after the Crown). Zoos, museums and botanical gardens • Formed as ‘arks’ for endangered species • Undertook captive breeding and reintroduction programmes • E.g. restocking of American West with bison Discussion: the role of zoos and botanical gardens • How successful have zoos and botanical gardens been in terms of conservation? • Can you think of examples? The IUCN • International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources • Formed in 1947 by United Nations Scientific, Education and Cultural Programme (UNESCO) • Allowed international development funds to be used for conservation • Formulated international policy agendas • E.g. global network of nature reserves • Encouraged governments of developing countries to establish conservation departments • Issues best-practice guidelines WWF • The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) • Now known as the World Wide Fund for Nature • Launched in 1961 to raise funds for global conservation • Worked with governments to build national conservation strategies International conservation networks • In the 1990’s IUCN and WWF accused of ‘neo- colonialism’ • Imposing western values on other cultures • WWF • Reformed country offices into independent organisations • Governed and staffed by local people • Global network coordinated by WWF International • Allows richer members to support programmes run by poorer members International conservation networks • Birdlife International • Small British conservation organisation • Formed international network of partnerships with bird conservation organisations worldwide • Gave them strong collective voice in policy negotiations • Allowed them to access international development funds • Network model now adopted by many other organisations Conservation International: Branded conservation • Originally formed to take advantage of international biodiversity funding • Made available by Convention on Biological Diversity • Proposed targeting international biodiversity conservation efforts at ‘biodiversity hotspots’ 36 Biodiversity Hotspots (Myers 1988, 2000) • Criteria • Must contain at least 1,500 species of vascular plants as endemics • more than 0.5% of the world's total • Must have lost at least 70% of its primary vegetation • Comprise 1.4% of Earth’s land surface • Contain • 45% of all known plant species • 35% of all known vertebrate species • Disproportionate amount of evolutionary diversity Discussion: biodiversity hotspots • What do you think of the ‘biodiversity hotspots’ approach to international conservation? Homework • Choose a conservation organisation • Research its history • Who started it? • What was its original purpose? • How has that changed over the years? • How is it organised? • What are the strengths and weaknesses of its organisational model? • For discussion next lecture","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
