Selection Joe Ironside Contents • Genetic drift • Natural selection Sampling error • A finite sample is unlikely to contain the same proportions as the population from which it is drawn • The smaller the sample, the greater the variation • In a natural population • Only a finite number of new organisms are produced each generation • Only a finite number of gametes are drawn from the gene pool • The smaller the number of breeding individuals • The greater the random variation in allele frequencies • Between generations Random changes in allele frequency • Amplitude (size) of change • Greater in smaller populations • Direction of change • Cannot be predicted • Over time • Alleles go extinct • Genetic variation declines • Occurs more quickly in smaller populations Extreme cases • Founder effect • Small group of individuals • Leaves original population to found new one • Bottleneck • Random event • Wipes out most of the population • Leaves only a small group Founder effectFounder effectFounder effect Example: polydactyly in Eastern Pennsylvania Amish • Eastern Pennsylvania – Settled by 200 German Amish immigrants • Married strictly within their own community • Ellis-van Creveld syndrome – Short stature and extra digits • Caused by recessive allele – Rare in the German population at large » Carried by one of the Amish settlers – Now common in Pennsylvania Amish population BottleneckBottleneckBottleneckBottleneckExample: Pingalap – Island of the colour-blind • Pingalap Atoll • Small, low-lying pacific island • Bottleneck • Typhoon in 1780’s killed all but 30 people • Sampling error • One of the survivors carried a rare allele for achromatopsia (extreme colour blindness) • Genetic drift • 10% of the population is now colourblind (homozygous for achromatopsia allele) • Allele frequency of approximately 0.32 Consequences of genetic drift • Loss of alleles • Reduced ability to evolve • Diversification of allele frequencies • Different populations diverge genetically • Reduced natural selection Natural Selection • Some genotypes are fitter than others • Fitter individuals produce more offspring during their lifetimes • This may be because they: – Live longer – Produce more offspring Fitness • Viability – Probability of surviving to reproductive age • Fertility – Number of offspring • That survive to reproductive age • Fitness – Product of viability and fertility • For all individuals of a given genotype Genotype Viability Fertility Fitness AA v11 f11 V11f11=W11 Aa v12 f12 V12f12=W12 aa v22 f22 V22f22=W22 Relative fitness (w) • Calculate the absolute fitness of each genotype • Divide by the fitness of the fittest genotype • Selection coefficient (s) • s=1-w Genotype Viability (v) Fertility (f) Absolute fitness (W) Relative

assumptions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium are valid • w is the average fitness of the population • Fitness of each genotype weighted by its frequency • w=p2w11+2pqw12+q2w22 Genotype Genotype frequency

conditions • Genetic differences between populations • May be important • For the persistence of those populations 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 0 10 20 30 40 50 GenerationsFrequency Directional selection • One allele is always at a selective disadvantage • Advantageous allele may be • Dominant • w11=w12>w22 • Codominant • w11>w12>w22 • Recessive • w11>w12=w22 • Advantageous allele will eventually be fixed • Irrespective of dominance • Rate of change in allele frequency • Highest when advantageous allele is dominant • But rare recessive alleles are hidden • Lowest when advantageous allele is recessive dominant recessive codominant Example: Industrial melanism in the peppered moth • Before 1848 • Only pale moths in UK • 1848 • 1% dark (Carbonaria) moths in Manchester • 1900 • 90% dark moths in Manchester • Still mostly pale moths in Scotland, Ireland & SW England • 1950-present • Steady decline in dark form • Mark-release-recapture Experiment • Indicated bird predation as cause of difference • Conclusion • Directional selection caused by environmental change • Rise and fall in atmospheric pollution Overdominance (balancing selection) • Heterozygous advantage • Heterozygote is fitter than either homozygote • w11<w12>w22 • Should maintain both alleles • Stable polymorphism • At equilibrium frequency p* • Depends on relative fitness of homozygotes
