Origin • 3.5 Billion years ago this cycle started to speed up as new players became involved. • Photosynthetic microorganisms converted CO2 into organic compounds. • These respired and released CO2 back into the atmosphere. • These processes continue until the current day. Short term carbon cycle • 1958 Charles Keeling started to monitor CO2 https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v437/n7057/full/437331a.html Increase in atmospheric CO2 300 310 320 330 340 350 360 370 58 60 62 64 66 68 70 72 74 76 78 80 82 84 86 88 90 92 94 YearCO2 concentration (ppm) Keeling et al., 1995 CO2 • Mean CO2 in 1958 was 315 ppm but was 404 ppm by 2015. • Summer CO2 concentration is lower than winter. • Why is it varying seasonally and over time? What makes CO2 vary? • Geological inputs (volcanoes and mid- ocean ridges) • Biological inputs (respiration) • Human inputs (deforestation and burning of fossil fuels). Removal of CO2 from the atmosphere • Geological removal where CO2 is exposed to weathered rocks. • Biological removal (photosynthesis) Photosynthesis and respiration are central to short-term C cycling Types of carbon • Green carbon = carbon stored in terrestrial vegetation and soils • Blue carbon = carbon stored in marine vegetated habitats and sediments • Brown carbon = greenhouse gas emissions • Black carbon = emissions as a result of imperfect combustion e.g. soot, dust Human activity has had significant impacts on C cycling • We know from use of isotopes. • Measurements from gas bubbles trapped in ice. • The rise in CO2 coincides with major advances in industrialisation. • Matching of carbon accounts that shows what we burn matches closely with what we would expect the atmospheric CO2 to be. What removes CO2 from the atmosphere? Photosynthesis and respiration are central to short-term C cycling Global carbon cycleGeological processes that drive the long term carbon cycle PhotosynthesisLeaf litter decomposition Decomposition - Breakdown of organic materials Detritivore Detritivores - Animal that feeds on dead organic matterThe soil is the layer of earth which plant roots grow in Arctic soils hold 1/3 of soil carbon Arctic Tropical rainforests Tropical rainforests have shallow soils >50% of global CO2 is captured by marine autotrophs (phytoplankton + macrophytes) Marine systems 8 Billion humans? Conclusions In this lecture we: • described the history of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) on planet earth • explored sources and sinks of CO2 • discussed rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations • described the carbon cycle with a focus on biological turnover • considered systems that are important in terms of carbon sequestration including tropical rainforests, the arctic and marine systems • discussed human activity and emissions of CO2","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":""}
