{"path":"University/University slides/Ecology and Conservation/Ecological organisation.pdf","text":"Ecological organisation Objectives By end of lecture, you should: • Understand levels at which ecosystems organised & studied (Organelle → Biosphere) • Appreciate physical environmental factors that dictate local ecology • Understand role of soil (& nutrients) as pivotal in formation of habitats & associated biodiversity • Important to select the correct level at which to investigate a particular problem • Selecting the wrong level will make it difficult to find the answer, or inefficient Ecological studies An ecological hierarchy BIOSPHERE ECOSYSTEM COMMUNITY SPECIES POPULATION INDIVIDUAL ORGAN CELL ORGANELLE GUILD To be comprehensive, we should always remember that there are levels of organisation below the individual BIOSPHERE ECOSYSTEM COMMUNITY SPECIES POPULATION INDIVIDUAL ORGAN CELL ORGANELLE GUILD Organelles are organised into cells… An ecological hierarchy BIOSPHERE ECOSYSTEM COMMUNITY SPECIES POPULATION INDIVIDUAL ORGAN CELL ORGANELLE GUILD Cells into organs… (for example, the various tissues that go to make up a plant leaf) An ecological hierarchy BIOSPHERE ECOSYSTEM COMMUNITY SPECIES POPULATION INDIVIDUAL ORGAN CELL ORGANELLE GUILD … and organs into an individual. (thus a plant comprises leaves, roots, stem and flowers) An ecological hierarchy BIOSPHERE ECOSYSTEM COMMUNITY SPECIES POPULATION INDIVIDUAL ORGAN CELL ORGANELLE GUILD Important to look at the lower level of organisation when trying to understand a causal mechanisms for change. Example – pollutant An ecological hierarchy A reed plant A sea urchin ‘Individuals’ – sometimes easy to recognize Individuals? • Are these individuals, or one plant vegetatively propagated via underground rhizomes? • Probably better to work at ‘population’ level • ‘Population’ definition: group of individuals of a particular species occurring in a particular location, at a particular time’ • Here we can also consider age, sex, fecundity etc. • Species often occur in predictable assemblages ‘Communities’ A grazed maritime grassland ‘community’ • Animal communities, e.g. sea cliff communities, where different species occupy different parts of cliff... • ...guillemots, on the ledges with their pyriform eggs • ...shags nesting in the gullies • Artificial communities • ‘Community’ definition: ‘A particular grouping of species occurring in a predictable manner in a specific location’ • A number of communities occurring together is an ‘ecosystem’ Satellite image of Dyfi estuary • False colours = wavelengths reflected from different vegetation types & other surfaces River Dyfi River Leri Grassland: red Organic soils: dark green Ynyslas sand dune ecosystem at mouth of Dyfi, with several plant communities... Ynyslas ‘foredunes’ • ‘Strandline community’ of annual plants at high tide mark • Sunbathing spot, so community poorly developed! • Any structure can intercept blown sand to cause accumulationIsland of Barra – Scotland – old oil drums ‘Yellow dunes community’ at Ynyslas • Marram grass colonises foredunes → sand accumulation ‘Grey dunes community’ • Marram still present (straw coloured vegetation), but being out-competed in stabilised community ‘Dune slack community’ shropshirewildlifetrust.org.uk • Marram still present (straw coloured vegetation), but being out-competed in stabilised community Dune woodland community in the Netherlands Artificial dunes community, Netherlands Coastal chaparral scrub Coniferous forest Desert Coniferous forest Prairie grassland Deciduous forest Appalachian mountains Sierra Nevada mountains Great American desert Great plainsRocky mountains Mississippi river valley Coastal mountain ranges Mean Annual Precipitation 100-125 cm 75-100 cm 50-75 cm 25-50 cm < 25 cm Term ‘biome’ used on grand scale Ecosystems together make up the Earth’s biological systems - referred to as the ‘biosphere’ • ‘Involves different species which all seem to have similar ecological characteristics’ The ‘guild’ Controversial Ecology • Collectively  ‘guild’ of insectivorous passerines ‘Guild’ example: resource utilisation • Feeding positions of 5 warbler species in conifer forest, NE USA • Zones of most concentrated feeding activity shaded: B, base of branches; M, middle of branches; T, ends of branches. ‘Epiphyte guild’ • Different plant species growing on surface of oil palm in Malaysia ‘Guild’ example: shared niche Physical aspects of the Environment Acidic soils, oak woods Geology determines type of ecosystem Basic soils, ash woods Geology determines type of ecosystem Waterlogged soil, bog system • Dry systems – vegetation still found Soils will significantly affect vegetation • Soil chemistry (acidic or basic) affects species that occur • Soil physical structure important – heavy clay hard for roots to penetrate • Soil physical structure important – here see bands of roots that only grow in cracks in heavy clay • Sea buckthorn produces nitrogen compounds in its roots → fertiliser action Vegetation also affects soils • When sea buckthorn shrubs cut, green patches remain – nutrient status of soil enhanced Summary • In studying Ecology we have to be aware of the biological hierarchy (Organelle...to Biosphere) • Ecologists can investigate individuals, populations, communities & guilds but they also study processes • The physical environment dictates local ecology • Soil (and nutrients) are pivotal in the formation of habitats and associated biodiversity References • Beeby, A. & Brennan, A.M.
