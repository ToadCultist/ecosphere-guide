The parent cell must be large enough to divide in two and still contribute sufficient cytoplasmic components to each daughter cell. Mitosis (non-germline somatic cells) For mitosis to occur: Prokaryote Cells Bacteria have small genomes (3 - 6 million nucleotides with few thousand genes). Single circular chromosome not within a nuclear membrane. Eukaryote Cells Higher plants/animals have large genomes (100 – 3000 million nucleotides with 10,000 – 30,000 genes). Multiple individual chromosomes housed within a nuclear membrane. Under favourable conditions, bacteria (like E. coli) divide every 20 mins. Population growth is by geometric progression: 1, 2, 4, 8, etc. This is called exponential growth. If start with one bacterial cell on your body and left it 12h. How many cells? 2 n (where n = the number of generations). 1 x 236 = 68,719,476,736 68 thousand million 6.8 x1010 Each division = DNA replication and cell splitting https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6akNYlkehYWatch this 40 sec clip of bacterial replicating. Prokaryote Cell division Single circular chromosome No nuclear membrane DNA replication must be complete prior to the cell splitting into two. Replication forks Parental strand Origin of Chromosomal Replication (oriC) Replication proceeds in both directions Daughter strand Prokaryote Cell division occurs in two phases: DNA replication Cell splitting DNA replication starts at a single point: replication origin Progresses around the chromosome via replication forks Prokaryote Cell division: DNA replication The circular bacterial DNA molecule is attached by proteins to the inner membrane 1 DNA replication begins at a specific location (oriC) 2 The newly synthesized DNA molecule is also attached to the inner membrane, near the attachment site of the initial molecule. 3 Protein attachment point DNA Newly synthesized DNA Prokaryote Cell division: Cell splitting / Fission The cell elongates symmetrically around the midpoint, separating the DNA attachment sites. 4 Cell division begins with the synthesis of new membrane and wall material at the midpoint. 5 Continued synthesis completes the constriction and separates the daughter cells. 6 M phase (Mitosis and cytokinesis) G2 phase (Gap 2) S phase (DNA synthesis) Interphase G1 phase (Gap 1) G0 phase (Cells that are not actively dividing) Cell Cycle (Eukaryotes) Interphase: G1, S and G2. G1 and G2. When cytoplasm & cell organelles get remade S phase = DNA synthesis Some cells do not enter G1:S:G2 but go into a non-dividing state G0 Include liver, nerve, sperm cells, erythrocytes and those that form the lens of the eye. M phase: When mitosis (but not DNA replication) occurs Eukaryote cell division is also divided into two main stages: Interphase and M phase Prokaryote v Eukaryote DNA replication Prokaryote Eukaryote Ori Replication forks Origin s Early stages in replication Later stages in replication Daughter copies of DNA (semi- conserved) Eukaryote Cell division DNA replication occurs at many replication forks Okasaki fragment Homologous chromosomes Sex chromosomes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 11 129 10 14 1513 17 1816 20 2119 22 X Human DNA Organization In eukaryotic cells, DNA is organized with histones and other proteins into chromatin, which is packaged into chromosomes. Humans normally have 22 pairs of homologous chromosomes (1−22 longest to the shortest) plus 1 pair of sex chromosomes. Centromeres/ChromatidsHomologous chromosomes Homologous chromosomes Centromeres Hold sisters together and house the Kinetochore which links to mitotic spindle Sister chromatids S phase Mitosis Stages Interphase G1 – S – G2 M Phase Prophase Metaphase (early /late) Anaphase Telophase Cytokinesis Prophase Prophase: Chromosomes condense. Centrioles make microtubules and migrate to opposite poles. 1 Mitotic spindles CentriolesNuclear envelope Chromatin fibers Interphase Late Prophase/ Early metaphase (AKA pro-metaphase) Prometaphase: Microtubules of the mitotic spindle attach to chromosomes. 2 Nuclear envelope starts to break down. Sister chromatids align on the equator. Centrioles move to poles of cell. Make microtubules which explore the space and attach to chromatids Sister chromatids Sister chromatids Centromere Kinetochore Spindle Kinetochores are where spindle microtubules attach to the centromere https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJrDsRuWxQ Watch the video (2 min 43 sec) to understand the role of the kinetochore. (Late) Metaphase Metaphase: Chromosomes align in center of cell. 3 Centriole and Spindle pole Anaphase Anaphase: Sister chromatids (which become individual chromosomes when the centromere splits) separate and are pulled to opposite poles by spindle. 4 Telophase Telophase: Nuclear envelope re-forms and chromosomes de-condense. 5 Cytokinesis (Animal) Centriole De-condensing chromosomes Re-forming nucleus Contractile ring (actin) Spindles Cytokinesis (Plant) Decondensing chromosomes Phragmoplast produces Cell plate Re-forming nucleus Spindles Click on the play button at the bottom of the slide to start a short animation (with voice over) that describes the main changes that occur in mitosis (1 min 15 sec) Mitosis / Cell Division Eukaryotes Prokaryotes Genome large with linear chromosomes Genome small with single circular chromosome DNA within nuclear membrane DNA in ‘cytoplasm’ DNA replication initiates at multiple sites Replication initiates at a single origin Mitosis divided into complex steps to ensure chromosomes are conserved Simple cell division Daughter cells possess the same DNA complement as the parent cell Sing along with the mitosis rap (3 min 17 sec) to remind you of the different stages and the cellular changes that occur in each. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOsAbTi9tHw https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofjyw7ARP1cWatch the video (5 min 42 sec) to remind you of the different stages of mitosis and the cellular changes that occur in each stage.","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":""}
