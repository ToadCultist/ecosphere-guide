Unicellular algae (e.g. Trebouxia) are commonest (80%) but also filamentous algae (e.g. Trentepohlia spp.)(10%) Cyanobacteria photobionts (10%) are mainly Nostoc or Scytonema spp. Cyanobacteria can fix N2 (heterocysts) Free-living algae/cyanobacteria are ‘trapped’ by fungi Trebouxia spp. are the most widespread Chlorphyta symbionts -seldom free-living (but can be cultured) http://www-biol.paisley.ac.uk/bioref/Chlorophyta/Trebouxia.html 14C incorporation into Peltigera polydactyla Rapidly converted to fungus-specific sugar mannitol total 14C fixed by photosynthesis 14C labelled mannitol (formed by fungus) Time (min)14C counts Dissociation / ResynthesisVariable photobionts Sticta canariensis Algal photobiont Pseudocyphellaria rufovirescens Cyanobacterial photobiont Lichen morphology Crustose Leprose Foliose Fruticose http://helios.bto.ed.ac.uk/bto/FungalBiology/chap13_5.htm Rhizines -attachment of foliose lichensLichen Dispersal Apothecia (with asci/ascospores) - dispersal of fungal partner only Diaspores - fragmentation propagules - contain algal cells surrounded by fungus - maintain the partnership - soredia / isidia (thallus outgrowths) Thallus ultrastructure Distinct layers in thallus Algal cells protected by fungal cortex Lower cortex acquires nutrients from substrate Algal cells are more ‘leaky’ within the thallus Water-repellent hydrophobins maintain air channels in thallus Haustorium Transmission EM Cladonia and Trebouxia spp. Nutrient transfer interfaceSomatic Incompatibility Non-self recognition - like zone lines in wood Intra-specific and inter-specific competition Protection of territory Soil crust stabilisation 'Toyota-isation' Lichens and air pollution Lichens inhabit exposed habitats, so sensitive to airborne pollutants SO2 pollution -acidification NOx pollution - affects competitive interactions (reduces fitness of N- fixing cyanobacterial symbionts Useful indicators of airborne pollution Xanthoria Lobaria Mynydd Parys, Amlwch, Anglesey (Copper Mountain -begun 1768) Thomas Pennant (1773), Tours in Wales, Vol. 3 First example of anthropogenic loss of biodiversity (SO2 pollution) The Human Microbiome Rapid advances made possible by NextGen Sequencing (aka amplicon sequencing or metabarcoding) to identify bacteria via 16S sequences Human gut bacteria: the simplistic viewMain bacterial inhabitants of human gut Firmicutes (Gram+, endospores; Clostridium, :Lactobacillus spp.). Bacteroidetes (Gram-, assoc w/ high fibre diet; Prevotella etc.) Proteobacteria (Gram-, E. coli, Pseudomonas etc., high sugar diet) Actinobacteria (Gram+, Propionibacterium); Others Stomach acid [pH2] is barrier to colonisation (and protects vs pathogens) Clostridium difficile caused inflammation of large bowel (colitis). Associated with hospitals, longterm antibiotic usage and old age Faecal transplant more effective than antibiotics for C. difficile therapy (2013) Network analysis identifies which bacteria co-occur and which are mutually exclusive Donor C.difficile Recipient Associated species Non-associated species (Fuentes et al., 2014) D R Gut microbes influence BMI (\"Infectobesity\") Bacteria digest polysaccharides and give rise to different fatty acids (FA) FAs can alter hormones associated with hunger (GLP-1/3 etc.) Mice inoculated with bacteria from lean/obese human twin pairs Drosophila raised on particular food (molasses [CMY] vs starch) tend to mate with flies raised on the same food Antibiotics abolish this effect The effect was re-established by infecting the flies with Lactobacillus plantarum (abundant in starch-raised flies [26%] vs molasses flies [3%]). Cuticular volatiles of flies are altered by Lactobacillus plantarum Assortative mating- 1st step in speciation Hologenome theory of evolution (Richard Jefferson, 1994) Unit of selection is the 'macrobe' plus its microbial symbionts =the Holobiont Extension of endosymbiont theory Mechanisms of stable vertical transmission are important (eg. acquisition of gut microbes from parent in mammals but not eg reptiles) END Lichen Ecology (‘timeshare’ on tree branches) Collema (lichen at edge) / Nostoc (freeliving cyanobacterium) in limestone hollows Geosiphon - non-lichen endosymbiosis 50 µm Intracellular bladders contain cyannobacteria cells (Nostoc ) Forms arbuscular mycorrhizas with higher plants Lichens (vs mycorrhizas) -fungal partner is the larger one NextGen Sequencing reveals huge microbial diversity on/in all larger Some pathogens But most have more subtle contribution Gut microbiome Clostridium difficile - Lichens and rock weathering Organic acids are acids secreted to release nutrients (P, K etc.) Important in rock weathering Competition, Dirty Tricks and Cheating Successional processes Lichenicolous lichens - photobiont ‘take-over’ Cheating -parasitic fungi Lichens in Medicine / Biotechnology Lichen metabolites used in traditional and modern medicine (e.g. Usnic acid from Usnea with antibiotic properties Litmus paper from Roccella tinctoria Used as traditional pigments (tartans etc.) Can be used to as substrate for ethanolic fermentation Lungwort - Lobaria Mycorrhizas - Photosynthetic partner generally larger than fungal partner Lichens -Photosynthetic partner (photobiont) is microscopic -Similarities with marine corals Fungal MutualismsVeteran TreesCladonia sp.
