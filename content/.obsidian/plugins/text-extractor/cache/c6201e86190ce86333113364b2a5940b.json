Retina Retina Photoreceptors Light Optic nerve Light To brain Choroid Neurons Cone Rod Ganglion cell Optic nerve axons Amacrine cell Horizontal cell Bipolar cell Pigmented epithelium How are the photoreceptors oriented in the retina? Where were photopigments located within photoreceptors? How did mammalian photoreceptors respond to light? Diversi ty of optics Diversity of camera eyes In many fish and cephalopods, focus is achieved by moving the lens rather than changing its shape.©2005 by The Royal Society Osorio D , and Vorobyev M Proc. R. Soc. B 2005;272:1745-1752 Diversity in photopigments… Most mammals are actually dichromats! Reptiles and birds are tetrachromats Many organisms have a UV- sensitive photopigment Ciliary and rhabdomeric photoreceptors • In many invertebrates, photopigments are in microvilli that make up rhabdomeres • Insect photoreceptors are depolarised rather than hyperpolarised by light Compound eyes Rhabdom Crystalline cone Lens Ommatidium Photoreceptor Axons Cornea  Many hundreds/thousands of ommatidia  Large dragonfly ~30,000  Blowfly ~4000  Drosophila ~750  Optimised for temporal over spatial acuitySpatial acuity A famous image by Kuno Kirschfeld This compound eye would give the same acuity in its fovea as human vision has Each ‘facet’ actually represents 10,000 ommatidia! Acute vision would require lots of ommatidia, but diffraction limits how small they can be Temporal acuity: selected critical flicker fusion frequencies Species CFF Anolis spp. 35Hz Homo sapiens 60Hz Columba livia 100Hz Glossina morsitans 145Hz Calliphora sp. 240Hz Apis mellifera 240Hz Inger R, Bennie J, Davies TW, Gaston KJ (2014) Potential Biological and Ecological Effects of Flickering Artificial Light.
