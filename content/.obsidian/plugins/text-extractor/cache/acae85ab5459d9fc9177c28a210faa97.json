Taxonomy: Morphologic relationships between organisms Systematics: taxonomy related to evolutionary processes Molecular Systematics: use of molecular data to reveal processes Classification….naming species to reflect the above. Central to Evolution is Adaptation An alteration of a living organisms that enable them to survive and reproduce in relation to its environment • Physical/structural • Metabolic • Behavioural Examples: woodpecker beak shape, camouflage Not everything is an adaptation – it must be explained So evolution is… Process by which populations adapt to their environments over time • Offspring have different traits which MUST passed on to the next generation Heritable traits Allele: alternative forms of the same gene Misconception: “Evolution is a theory about the origin of life Evolutionary theory deals mainly with how life changed after its origin. Science does try to investigate how life started (e.g., whether or not it happened near a deep-sea vet, which organic molecules came first, etc.), but these are not the central focus of evolutionary theory. Misconception: “Evolution is like a climb up a ladder of progress; organisms are always getting better.” Taxa may have changed and diversified a great deal—but that doesn’t mean they got “better.” What was “better” a million years ago, may not be “better” today. What works “better” in one location might not work so well in another. Fitness is linked to environment, not to progress. Misconception: “Natural selection involves organisms ‘trying’ to adapt.” • Natural selection leads to adaptation, but the process doesn’t involve “trying.” • Natural selection involves genetic variation and selection among variants present in a population. • Either population has the alleles that are good enough to survive and reproduce, or it does not—but it cannot get the right alleles by “trying.” • Natural selection has no intentions or senses; it cannot sense what a species “needs.” • If that genetic variation is not in the population, the population may still survive (but not evolve much) or it may die out. But it will not be granted what it “needs” by natural selection Misconception: “Natural selection gives organisms what they ‘need.’ ”","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
