Moose will destroy branches over the winter, rip bark away Reindeer are herded and moved up the hills in the summer. Lemmings can have significant impact during population outbreaks. Tend to eat the plant roots. Abiotic factors Elevated CO2 concentrations UV-B radiation due to ozone depletion Extreme events Changing air & soil temperatures Other functions of birch • Dense canopies serve as good nesting cover • For insects such as autumn moth serves as a food Other functions of birch On birch, you will observe large numbers of root nodules – these are mycorrhizas Man and birch The native people would build Lap huts that have simple designs with a peaty turf covering See how hundreds of branches are tied to construct the structure Man and birch Birch therefore has both historical and ecological significance Symbiotic Associations Homes: Insects, birds, man Lemming burrows Shade: mosses, lichens Biotic factors: Food, larvae → parasites, aphids / leaf borers, reindeer, birds. Free living fungi / bacteria Nutrients Decomposition Competition Abiotic factors: Light, water (rain / snow) CO2 concentration, UV-B, temperature. Detritovores Socio-economic factors: Crafts, wine, firewood, fencing, homes, etc. Summary • Kruuk, H. (1995) Wild Otters. Oxford University Press, UK. • Beeby, A. & Brennan, A.M.
