B: Gram-positive bacteria have a single lipid membrane surrounded by a cell wall composed of a thick layer of peptidoglycan and lipoteichoic acid, which is anchored to the cell membrane by diacylglycerol. C: Cell walls of mycobacteria consist of thin layers of peptidoglycan and arabinogalactan, and a thick layer of mycolic acids. D: A single plasma membrane is also present in fungi, surrounded by a cell wall consisting of various layers of the polysaccharides chitin, β-glucan and mannan.

It is deposited before and during active growth and is flexible enough to expand as the cell grows. Up 80% of its fresh weight is water. Pore size is 5-10 nm. The secondary cell wall is a thick and tough structural and protective layer deposited inside the primary wall. Incapable of expanding, it is only created in cells that have finished growing. Contains little water. The middle lamella is a layer of glue-like pectin and other compounds responsible for keeping cells together and organised into tissues BR17520 The main components of the plant cell wall The cell wall: a macro-molecular composite Cellulose Hemicellulose Pectin Phenolics (lignin) Cell wall proteins BR17520 Cellulose Left panel: monomers.

BR17520 Cell wall biosynthesis: Cellulose Orientation of cellulose microfibrils within the plant cell wall influences the direction in which the cell elongates Although turgor pressure is uniform in all directions, each cell tends to elongate in a direction perpendicular to the orientation of the microfibrils, which have great tensile strength The final shape of an organ, such as the shoot, is determined by the direction in which its cells expand BR17520 Cell wall biosynthesis: hemicellulose and pectins Geisler et al. Current Opinion in Plant Biology 2008, 11: 647–652 The biosynthesis of hemicelluloses and pectins takes mainly place in the Golgi and involves the action of hundreds of different glycosyltransferases (GTs), the enzymes that catalyse the transfer of sugar moieties from activated donor molecules to specific acceptor molecules, forming glycosidic bonds.
