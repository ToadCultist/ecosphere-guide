Th e global challenges facing the planet in terms of climate change and pressures upon landscapes for food, fuel, and human population growth have increased further; so too has the political and scientifi c will to fi nd pragmatic solutions to these challenges. An understanding of the evolutionary and ecological processes responsible for driving one of the most important parts of Earth’s ecosystem, the plants, is paramount to this. What is also apparent is that understanding these processes requires studies spanning a very long timescale. Evolutionary change occurs over millions of years and even ‘shorter-term’ ecological processes may take hundreds of years to become apparent (given that the average generation times of most trees is between 50–100 years). From changes occurring in genes, through to species, communities, and biomes, a knowledge of processes occurring in deep time is essential; it is only by addressing these timescales that a proper appreciation of natural variability of ecosystems, their resilience to environmental change, and their propensity to alter can occur. A huge volume of literature and excellent studies on plant evolution go before this book, and this volume is fi rst and foremost dedicated to the scholars of this work. Th is book represents a synthesis of these studies put into an environmental framework. We review the evidence for major intervals of plant evolution in Earth’s history and discuss them against the geological evidence for the global environmental change occurring at the same time. Th ese include, for example, episodes of major plate movements, intervals of ice-house and green-house Earth, changing atmospheric concentrations, and altered incoming solar energy. Understanding how ecosystems in the past responded to warmer global temperatures and much higher levels of atmospheric CO 2 is particularly poignant—but so too is an understanding of plant responses to intervals of higher UV-fl ux, atmospheric O 2 , and episodes of increased variability in the climate. Over the past twelve years, the knowledge base in some areas of this research has greatly increased, particularly in the use of molecular phylogenies to understand evolutionary relationships. Important new fossil discoveries, the application of cutting edge method- ology, and the development of new proxies, together with more concise dating of sequences, have also resulted in a more in-depth understanding of plant evolution as revealed from the fossil record. Th e dating of major transitions in plant evolution, determined predominantly through the fossil records, have withstood the test of time, although there are now many more detailed taxonomic and envi- ronmental datasets available to provide a more detailed overview of these critical intervals in time. A number of people were involved in the shaping of the fi rst edition of the book and we gratefully acknowledge their contribution once again. To this list we now need to add Lydia Cole and Eva Herre- ros for their huge eff orts in general editing, inputting references and collation of datasets.

If plants are mentioned it is only in passing and usually to reconstruct the environment in which to view the animal record. Yet from the earliest fossil records plants have provided an equally diverse and interesting picture. Th e earliest fossil photosynthesizers date back to >2500 million years ago (Ma) (early Archean) ( Schopf, 2011 ) and some of the earliest eukaryotes were plants, namely green algae ( Knoll, 2003 ). Plants colonized terrestrial environments in the upper Ordovician ~450 Ma ( Wellman et al . 2003 ), and in a matter of 100 million years had evolved from toe-brushing specimens to trees up to 60 m in height ( Edwards, 1996 ; Stein et al ., 2007 ). Th e fi rst seed-bearing plants evolved approximately 380 million years ago, but it was another 180 million years before the fi rst fl owers appeared, and grasses did not appear until ~65 million years ago. In comparison to animals, plants have a limited list of basic needs (H 2 O, CO 2 , N, Mg, P, K, some trace elements, photons, plus various biochemical pathways necessary for photosynthesis) and this list has remained relatively unchanged throughout the evolutionary record ( Knoll, 1984 ; Traverse, 1988a ). Many plants also have in-built mechanisms for cop- ing with environmental stress, including seed dormancy and leaf-shedding, mechanisms of die-back where the plant can perennate as underground stems or rhizomes, and the ability to regenerate vegetatively aft er trauma. In addition, plants are not, as a rule, nearly as sensi- tive as animals to population size dynamics. A ‘deme’ of vascular plants consisting of only a few individuals can persist far better than a small tetrapod animal deme ( Knoll, 1984 ). Plants can also live for a very long time, with some species, such as the bristle cone pine ( Pinus longaeva ) for example, living for up to 4800 years ( Schulman, 1958 ), providing one of the oldest known and longest-lived organisms on Earth ( Flanary and Kletetschka, 2005 ). Unlike the animal record, there are also many extant plant families that have persisted, oft en in morphologically identical forms, for over 200 million years ( Traverse, 1988a ; Royer et al ., 2003 ), including, for example, members of the ferns (Filicopsids), the ginkgos (Ginkgoales), and the conifers (Coniferales). Th us in both the study of phenotypic and genotypic evolu- tion, plants off er a fascinating record. 01-WillisandMcElwain-Chap01.indd 101-WillisandMcElwain-Chap01.indd 1 11/28/13 10:29 AM11/28/13 10:29 AM 2 1 THE EVOLUTIONARY RECORD AND METHODS OF RECONSTRUCTION Over the past 35 years a revolution in evolutionary thinking has occurred. In particular, the traditional view that evolution is a gradual process of change resulting from increasing minute adaptation to other species and the environment ( Darwin, 1859 ) has been challenged. An alternative school of thought proposes that speciation is a sudden and rapid process in- terspersed with periods of stasis (punctuated equilibrium) ( Eldredge and Gould, 1972 ; Gould and Eldredge, 1993 ). Th ese ideas have been further developed to suggest that intervals of environmental change, ranging from those brought about by the cyclical changes in climate resulting from the position of the Earth in relation to the sun (orbital forcing) ( Vrba, 1985 , 1995 ; Bennett, 1990 , 1997 ; Mayhew et al ., 2008 ), to long-term changes in atmospheric com- position ( Beerling et al ., 2001 ; Sage, 2004 ; Berner et al ., 2007 ; Willis et al ., 2009 ; McElwain et al ., 2011 ), sea-level, and climate driven by global plate movements (e.g. Hallam and Wignall, 1999 ; Wignall, 2001 ; Courtillot and Renne, 2003 ; Ganino and Arndt, 2009 ) might provide the necessary mechanism for pulses of speciation. But the majority of discussion has centred on the animal record and the same questions need to be asked of the plant record. For example, is there evidence for gradual evolutionary change or periods of stasis interspersed with pulses of rapid speciation? How do the patterns seen in the plant record relate to the animal record? Are there mass extinction events comparable to those seen in the animal record? Also, if the theory of punctuated equilibrium is applicable to the plant record, is there evidence to suggest that the mechanisms driving the pulses of speciation in the animal record are the same for plants? Traditionally these questions were addressed using the fossil record alone. However in recent years important advances in evolutionary studies have taken place against a backdrop of an increased understanding of genotypic change. In particular, the ability to reconstruct phylogenies based on molecular characteristics and to calculate rates of genotypic evolution are providing yet another data set to study plant evolution. Th ese can be used to compare and contrast processes and mechanisms of long-term biological evolution. Th ere are also new lines of data becoming available from biomarkers and iso- topes contained in organic matter in sedimentary sequences. Th ese are starting to provide important evidence of the evolution of metabolic pathways in plants, including one of the most fundamental to life on Earth, the process of photosynthesis. Th is book aims to provide an overview of the main evolutionary changes that have occurred in the plant kingdom, from the fi rst prokaryotic photosynthesizers to the pre- sent, within a framework of the environmental changes that were occurring at the time. Chapters 1–6 examine the predominant evolutionary patterns in the plant fossil record that have occurred over the past 3.5 billion years from the fi rst prokaryotes to our present fl ora. Evolutionary trends apparent from morphological, genetic and metabolic data are presented alongside evidence in geological records for global environmental change. Each chapter aims to synthesize the evidence for the timing of evolutionary innovations (e.g. leaves, roots, seeds, fl owers) and origin of the major plant groups and considers these in the environ- mental context in which they were occurring. Next the evidence for mass extinctions and persistent plant populations in the fossil record is examined and compared to that seen in the animal fossil record. Th e fi nal chapter views the evolutionary trends outlined in the book in the light of diff erent evolutionary theories; does the evolutionary plant record indicate a ‘cone of increasing diversity’ or decimation and diversifi cation? Is there evidence in the plant record for gradual long-term change (phyletic gradualism) or periods of stasis interspersed by rapid change (punctuated evolution)? Are changes in the plant record similar to those 01-WillisandMcElwain-Chap01.indd 201-WillisandMcElwain-Chap01.indd 2 11/28/13 10:29 AM11/28/13 10:29 AM 31.3 METHODS OF RECONSTRUCTION seen in the animal record? And is it possible to detect processes and driving mechanisms of long-term plant evolution? 1.2 The geological timescale Th e geological timescale subdivides the past 4600 million years (since the Earth’s formation) into hierarchical divisions: eras, periods, and epochs ( Figure 1.1 ) ( Gradstein et al ., 2004 , 2012 ; Ogg et al ., 2008 ). All the standard stratigraphic divisions are based on fossil stratigraphies (biostratigraphy). Th ere are three major era boundaries, two of which are defi ned by mass extinctions in the animal record and the third by the rapid expansion of multicellular animals (Gould, 1989 ). Th e boundary between the Mesozoic and Cenozoic is dated at 66 million years ago (Ma), when non-avian dinosaurs died out along with 75 per cent of marine invertebrates. Th e boundary between the Palaeozoic and Mesozoic is dated at 252 Ma, when there was the ex- tinction of up to 96 per cent of marine species in the geological record. Th e boundary between the Palaeozoic and Precambrian (Proterozoic) is placed at 541 Ma, and is characterized by a major increase in numbers of multicellular animals with hard parts soon aft er the boundary, known as the Cambrian explosion. At all levels of the hierarchy, however, it is important to note how many of the boundaries are based solely on changes in the animal record. As pointed out by Traverse ( 1988a ) , if the geological record had been based on changes in the plant fossil record then a very diff erent hierarchical structure would have resulted ( Figure 1.2 ). Th roughout this book the traditional geological timescale (geochronological scale) will be used and major changes that have occurred in the plant fossil record are viewed within this framework. In order to provide accessibility to non-geologists, all changes will be referred to in terms of million years before present (Ma) based on the International Commission on Stratigraphy ( http://www.stratigraphy.org ). Unit names and boundary estimates follow those of the International Commission on Stratigraphy ( Ogg, 2004 ) ( Figure 1.1 ). 1.3 Methods of reconstruction Currently there are two approaches used to reconstruct evolutionary change through time. Th e fi rst is based on the premise that ‘the past is a key to the present’. Traditionally this is the geological approach involving a detailed examination of the fossil record, including visible fos- silized plant remains (e.g. leaves, roots, shoots, pollen, spores, stomata) and also the molecular markers left behind by these plants (e.g. biomolecules and stable carbon isotopes). Th e second approach, which tends to be more favoured by ecologists and those interested in genotypic evolution, is based on the premise that ‘the present is a key to the past’. Th is approach involves the examination of present-day organisms and, through the assessment of similar/dissimilar characteristics in other organisms, the inference of possible evolutionary pathways. Again, studies for this approach include those at both a whole-organism and molecular level but most recently the focus has been particularly at the genetic level with the development of molecular phylogenetics. Both approaches have their advantages and shortfalls and are best used in con- junction with each other and there is now considerable integration of these two records in the subjects of Earth sciences, evolutionary biology, and ecology (Peterson et al ., 2007). 01-WillisandMcElwain-Chap01.indd 301-WillisandMcElwain-Chap01.indd 3 11/28/13 10:29 AM11/28/13 10:29 AM 4 1 THE EVOLUTIONARY RECORD AND METHODS OF RECONSTRUCTION Figure 1.1 The geological timescale (simpliﬁ ed).

Each can be attributed to a distinctive preservational environment. Compression/impression fossils One of the simplest types of preservation for plants is as a compression fossil. Compression fossils are formed in a variety of freshwater and marine environments including lagoons, estuaries, rivers, and lakes, or any other environment where plant parts are buried rapidly by a sedimentary layer. As subsequent layers accumulate, the water is squeezed out, the sedi- ment becomes more compact, and the plant fragments within it become fl attened. Th is will result in one of three types of compression fossil ( Chaloner, 1999 ), as follows: (i) Th e most basic type of compression fossil is where internal material is obliterated and all that is left is a thin carbonaceous fi lm that conforms to the original outline of the plant. Th ese types of compressions are frequently found in shales above coal seams. Information that can be gained from such fossils includes details about the morphology of the part pre- served, as well as some biomolecular information. (ii) Another type of compression fossil results from the imprint of the fossil, thus in eff ect an ‘impression’ fossil that is a negative imprint of the organism. In this type of fossil formation, organic material has been removed and the only information retained will be features of the surface structure and details of shape and size. (iii) When the compression occurs under anoxic (in the absence of oxygen) and acid conditions, the cell contents are oft en intact, providing much fi ner anatomical detail than in the above two examples. Plant cuticle, which remains structurally unaltered, is commonly preserved in this type of compression fossil ( Taylor, 1999 ) ( Figure 1.3 ). Aer- ial parts of all vascular land plants are covered with cuticle to prevent excessive water loss from the plant surface. Cuticle has a very stable chemical structure, providing both resistant outer protection to the plant and the ability to survive biological and geologi- cal processes through time ( Mösle et al ., 1997 ). An interesting feature of the fossil cuticle is that it refl ects the epidermal layer that it covers, so features such as stomata, papillae, and glands are preserved. Each plant genus has a very distinctive cuticular pattern ( Figure 1.3 ) (the plant equivalent of the fi ngerprint), thus extraction and analysis can pro- vide not only important information about the epidermal structure of the plant but also identifi cation of disarticulated plant parts, e.g. fl owers and seeds ( Kerp and Krings, 1999 ; Haworth and McElwain, 2008 ; Barclay et al ., 2007 ). Technically, coal is also a compression fossil ( Scott, 1987 ; Taylor and Taylor, 1993 ), although in this case it represents a heterogeneous mix of plants originally growing in vast regions of swamp. Coal is classified according to the degree to which the deposit has been compressed and thermally altered. In the least-crushed material (lignite), many plant parts can be recognized and extracted. One of the main advantages of studying coal deposits is that they represent the local community of plants growing in ancient swamps. 01-WillisandMcElwain-Chap01.indd 601-WillisandMcElwain-Chap01.indd 6 11/28/13 10:29 AM11/28/13 10:29 AM 71.3 METHODS OF RECONSTRUCTION Permineralized fossils Permineralization results from the infi ltration and permeation of the plant tissues by mineral-charged water. Over time, intracellular and interstitial precipitation of the dissolved mineral results in hardening within the plant and it eff ectively becomes solid rock. Th us, although the plant cell walls still consist of organic matter, they have been chemically altered and the intercellular spaces and cell lumens are fi lled with precipitated mineral. It is oft en stated that the process of permineralization is the most informative mode of preservation for the study of fossilized plants ( Schopf, 1975 ). Th is is because permineralization tends to result in the three-dimensional fossilization of plants ( Figure 1.4 ), with exquisitely pre- served detail down to the cellular level. To study the fi ne structure of permineralized fossils, it is necessary to prepare thin sections of the fossil that will allow the passage of transmitted light. Th is enables examination of not only external morphological features of the plant, but also transverse and longitudinal cross sections ( Kenrick, 1999 ). A number of diff erent types of permineralized fossils are found in the geological record ( Figure 1.5 ). Pyritic and limonitic permineralization, for example, results from the infi ltra- tion and precipitation of the cells by iron sulphides (pyrites) and hydrated iron oxides (limo- nites), whereas siliceous permineralization results from the deposition of microcrystalline colloidal silica. Whole plants (including trees) can be preserved this way. A Middle Triassic (~245–228 Ma) fossil forest, for example, has been discovered in Antarctica ( Cúneo et al ., 2003 ). Th is forest, which consists of 99 silicifi ed trees, is so well preserved that examination of its tree density, total forest cover per hectare and basal area per stump can be measured; (a) (b) (c) 30μm 20μm Figure 1.3 Compression fossil of (a) Ginkgo huttonii (~160 Ma) showing thick cuticle peeling off the rock (reproduced with kind permission from W.

Tree-ring analysis on the stumps also revealed seasonality favourable for plant growth. ‘Coal balls’ are a distinctive and much cited form of permineralized fossil. Th ese are balls of calcite, found exclusively in peat of Carboniferous age (~358–298 Ma) from deposits in Europe and North America, and of Permian age (~290 Ma) from Chinese deposits. Th ey vary considerably in size but are usually crudely spheroidal, c . 10–20 cm radius ( Figure 1.6 ), and composed of numerous plant fragments incorporated within a calcium carbonate ma- trix. Similar to lignite, they contain a broad spectrum of plant fragments from the swamps in which they were formed ( Phillips and DiMichele, 1999 ). Palaeoecological studies of coal ball fl oras have revealed some of the most detailed patterns on past vegetation responses to climate change ( DiMichele and Phillips, 1996 ; DiMichele et al ., 2009 ). Th ere are a number of theories as to how coal balls are formed ( Scott and Rex, 1985 ; Scott et al . 1996 ), since it is not immediately apparent why such rounded calcium carbonate concretions should be found within swamp and peat deposits. One theory suggests that coal balls re- sulted from the transgression of marine water over the swamps and that calcium carbonate Figure 1.6 Fossil coal ball showing detail of fossil plant fragments. © The Field Museum, #GEO86323.

Th is theory is not entirely satisfactory because it does not explain why the material is concentrated into balls. Another marine theory, therefore, is that coal balls were only formed when storms brought mud rollers and carbonate into the swamp, and that it was these rollers that formed the coal balls ( Figure 1.7 b). A non-marine theory has also been proposed, suggesting that coal balls result from the carbonate-rich permineralizing water derived from a groundwater supply ( Figure 1.7 c) infi ltrating up into the swamp layers. However, the third theory is thought to be less probable since the majority of coal balls appear to have been formed in basins with evidence for a marine infl uence and none have been found in freshwater lake basins ( Scott et al ., 1996 ). Besides being in plentiful supply and providing a broad representation of plant life in the Carboniferous and Permian swamps, coal balls also have the additional attraction of easy extraction of fossil material contained within them. Th e extraction process involves slicing the coal ball in half with a diamond saw, fi ne-abrasive polishing of the newly cut surface, and then placing the polished surface in a dilute solution of hydrochloric acid ( Galtier and Phillips, 1999 ). Th e calcium carbonate is etched away, leaving the plant material prominent on the surface. Acetone is then poured on this surface and an acetate sheet applied. Th e Figure 1.7 Three main theories accounting for the formation of coal balls: (a) marine-inﬂ uenced coal balls; (b) mixed coal-ball formation; (c) non-marine coal-ball formation. Reproduced from A.

Once the acetone evaporates, the acetate sheet once again hardens, and as it is pulled away, a detailed thin-section of the organic plant material contained within the coal ball is obtained on the peel. Th is can be examined using conventional microscopy. Unaltered plant remains Th e fi nal plant ‘fossilization’ process to be discussed in this section is one that results in rela- tively unaltered plant material (leaves, stems, roots, seeds, stomata, etc.) being preserved for millions of years. Th e most important factor in the preservation of unaltered plant material appears to be burial in an environment where microbial activity is inhibited, or at least se- verely restricted ( Eglinton and Logan, 1991 ). Such situations include those where the or- ganic material is desiccated or frozen, where there are environmental extremes of salinity, temperature, or pH, or in the absence of oxygen (anoxic environment). Frozen samples tend to contain only relatively recent fossils (<3 Ma) yet can provide an excellent level of detail ( Castello and Rogers, 2005 ). For example, the diverse plant macrofossils contained in the stomach of a 22,000 year old frozen Pleistocene mammoth has enabled a detailed reconstruction of the vegetation on the landscape on which it was grazing ( Van Geel et al ., 2008 ). Similarly well-preserved ancient chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) recovered from Siberian permafrost and dating up to 300,000–400,000 years old has enabled reconstruction of the diverse assemblages of plants that grew at this time ( Willerslev et al ., 2003 ). Another preservation medium that provides a relatively short-term (<1 Ma) yet ‘unaltered’ fossil plant record is the packrat, porcupine, and hyrax middens found in the arid areas of south-western North America, the Middle East and South Africa ( Betancourt et al ., 1990 ). Th ese middens, which provide shelter/nests for the animals, are constructed of plant mate- rial that they collected and that became encased in crystallized urine. Th e animals appear to sample species richness adequately within their foraging area. Th e crystallized urine (am- berat), combined with the extremely dry environment, provides an exceptional preservation medium, and although the plant material within the midden represents a time-slice of prob- ably no more than 5 years, middens dating back to beyond 40,000 years have been discovered. For deeper time, the most common deposits from which unaltered plant remains have been recovered are lake sediments and amber. Such an exceptional state of preservation ex- ists that oft en, when fi rst exposed, leaves are still green, fl owers are identifi able, and delicate plants like mosses are preserved ( Figure 1.8 ). Many exceptional plant fossils have been recov- ered from lake sediments, where burial has been rapid and the environment at the bottom of the lake is anoxic. An example of this type of burial includes the Clarkia beds in Idaho, where thousands of early Miocene fossil leaves (~17–20 Ma) have been recovered. In the Clarkia beds it has been proposed that, in addition to rapid burial, the leaves went through natural dehydration before abscission, resulting in a release of high concentrations of plant phenols. Th ey were then rehydrated in tannin-rich waters (plants with normally high tannin contents are oft en found in the best state of preservation) when deposited in the lake ( Niklas et al ., 1985b ), thus leading to exceptional preservation. Ancient biomolecules recovered from the Clarkia beds include lipids, bioterpenoids, fl avonoids, carotenoids, and chlorophyll deriva- tives (e.g. Rieseberg and Soltis, 1987 ; Yang and Huang, 2003 ; Otto et al ., 2005 ). 01-WillisandMcElwain-Chap01.indd 1101-WillisandMcElwain-Chap01.indd 11 11/28/13 10:29 AM11/28/13 10:29 AM 12 1 THE EVOLUTIONARY RECORD AND METHODS OF RECONSTRUCTION Th e outer walls of pollen and spores (exine) are also exceptionally well preserved in lake sediment, although, in this case, it is due both to the anoxic conditions in the lake and also the remarkable resilience of the exine ( Coxon and Clayton, 1999 ). Exines are composed of a material called sporopollenin that has exceptionally strong chemical bonds. Th e strength of this material is demonstrated by the fact that extraction of pollen and spore exines from a sedimentary matrix uses hydrofl uoric acid to dissolve the rock, yet the cell walls of the pollen and spores remain in a relatively unaltered state ( Bennett and Willis, 2002 ). Th is strength has also been demonstrated in the fossil record where studies have indicated the presence of Triassic fossil plant spores (~225 Ma) in rocks that would have undergone high-pressure metamorphic conditions (~14 kbar, ~360 °C) during the uplift of the French Alps ( Bernard et al ., 2007 ). One main advantage of using the pollen and spore record is that it provides a broader picture of the regional vegetation and not just of the local environment in which the fossil is preserved, which can bias other fossil records (e.g. leaves and wood in lowland swamps) ( Mander et al ., 2010 ; Willis et al ., 2010 ). It is not surprising, therefore, that some of the earliest records of new plant groups in the fossil record are from pollen and spores, including the earliest land plants ( Wellman et al ., 2003 ), the earliest gymnosperms and angiosperms ( Traverse, 1988b ; Hughes, 1994 ), and the rise of the grasses ( Stromberg, 2011 ). Amber is another important preservation medium for ‘unaltered’ plant remains. Amber is a fossilized plant resin, most oft en formed by members of the conifer family Araucariaceae, Figure 1.8 Photograph of ~34 million year old whole fossil moss ( Plagiopodopsis cockerelliae ) preserved in lake sediments from Florissant National Monument.

It is made up of the sugars glucose, galactose, and arabinose, as well as various acids, alcohols, and esters. When the resin is formed it is very sticky and any animal or plant fragments (e.g. small fl owers, leaves, seeds, pollen, and insects) that fall into it are incorporated. Once covered by the resin, the sugars withdraw the moisture from the original tissue and initiate the process of inert dehydra- tion ( Poinar et al ., 1996 ). Th is process is rapid and eff ectively the plant fragments become encased in a dehydrated state. Fossil plant remains contained in amber-bearing deposits have been recovered from a number of localities in the northern and southern hemisphere with recent examples including deposits from Italy ( Trevisani et al ., 2005 ) and the Western Amazon basin ( Antoine et al ., 2007 ). Th e most extensive records to date, however, have been collected in the Dominican Republic from amber deposits dating between 45–15 Ma ( Poinar and Poinar, 1999 ; Poinar, 2005 ). Wildfi re and volcanic events can also preserve plant structures and organs in morphologi- cally relatively unaltered states. Fossil charcoal, called fusain, is produced when organic mate- rial is heated to high temperatures in the absence of oxygen by wildfi re or volcanic pyroclastic fl ows. Charcoalifi cation results in near perfect cellular-level preservation of wood, leaves, and reproductive organs. Understanding of the evolution of fl oral structure and many of the key early steps in angiosperm evolution has come from detailed examination of charcoalifi ed fl owers ( Friis et al ., 2006 ) ( Figure 1.9 ). Fossil charcoal also provides a window on ancient fi re Figure 1.9 Scanning electron micrograph image of a Cretaceous aged (~100 Ma) fossil ﬂ ower preserved as charcoal from Allon, Georgia, USA. © The Field Museum, #GEO86876d. Ian Glasspool. 01-WillisandMcElwain-Chap01.indd 1301-WillisandMcElwain-Chap01.indd 13 11/28/13 10:29 AM11/28/13 10:29 AM 14 1 THE EVOLUTIONARY RECORD AND METHODS OF RECONSTRUCTION ecology ( Glasspool and Edwards, 2004 ; Scott, 2000 ) and palaeoatmospheric concentration of oxygen throughout the Phanerozoic ( Belcher and McElwain, 2008 ; Glasspool and Scott, 2010 ). How complete is the fossil plant record? Th e fossil record of plants preserves only a very small fraction of the species that existed over the past 450 million years. As with all fossil material, those parts of the plant that are fossilized (e.g. leaves, pollen, and spores) therefore represent a biased record of the once living vegetation. Awareness of the factors controlling the incorporation of plant material into sediments and ultimately rocks is therefore needed when interpreting trends in plant evolution and ecology ( Behrensmeyer et al ., 2000 ). A branch of palaeobotany, called tapho- nomy, investigates these biases involved in the transformation of a living plant community to an assemblage of fossil plants ( Gastaldo, 2001 ). Taphonomy examines the likelihood of a particular plant species or individual plant or organ becoming a fossil. Important factors that alter the likelihood of fossilization include the chemical make-up of the organ/plant, the ease with which it can be transported to an environment of deposition, and the ecology and life history of the plant/organ. For example, a deciduous tree will lose more leaves per year than an evergreen tree; however, evergreen leaves are less degradable and more transport- able than deciduous leaves. All of these factors infl uence which leaf type and ecology will be preserved and therefore better represented in the fossil record. Many of the key processes infl uencing the quality of the fossil record are summarized in Figure 1.10 .

The types of depositional environments that plant organs can fall into and become buried by sediment (shown in boxes) include limnic (lake), overbank, and river (ﬂ uvial) deposits. Plant organs can be preserved close to the original parent vegetation (autochthonous assemblages), some distance away (parautochthonous assemblages), or great distances away (allochthonous assemblages).

Fossil plant biomolecules Plant evolution as revealed in the fossil record is not exclusively based on fossilized whole organs such as leaves, fl owers, or fruits. Plant biomolecules including fossilized molecules and even fossil atoms and their isotopic variation can also provide impor- tant information on the evolutionary process. Plant tissues that have a protective role, such as cuticle which covers the aerial parts of all land plants, or the exine which is the protective outer wall of pollen and spores, are made up of biomacromolecules. Th ese biomacromolecules (oft en known as biomarkers) are highly resistant to decay ( Van Bergen et al ., 1995 ), are very well preserved in the rock record, and have provided im- portant insights into the timing of origin of new plants groups and biochemical pathways. Cutan-like biomacromolecules, for example, have been isolated from fossil Ginkgo leaves of Cretaceous age (~70 Ma), which show almost identical chemical structure to leaves of living Ginkgo ( Collinson et al ., 1994 ) ( Figure 1.11 ). Similarly suberin-like biomacromolecules have been found in fossil lycopsid bark from the Carboniferous (358–298 Ma) ( Collinson et al ., 1994 ) and lignins have been isolated from a wide range of fossil plants of diff erent ages ( Van Bergen et al ., 1995 ; Witkowski et al ., 2012 ). Increasingly the evidence from these studies indicates that the chemical make-up of many of the more resistant fossil plant tissues has remained highly conserved through geological time. Th e ability to isolate recognizable chemical constituents of fossil plants (biomarkers) has far-reaching potential in terms of the interpretation of the fossil record. To date, study of these ancient biomarkers has focused on three main areas of research ( Farrimond and Eglinton, 1990 ; Eglinton and Logan, 1991 ; Van Bergen, 1999 ; Collinson, 2011 ), namely: a) the use of chemical biomarkers in the identifi cation of morphologically indistinct organic Figure 1.11 Infrared spectra of cuticle from living modern and 70 million year old (Ma) Ginkgo leaves. Results show clear similarities between the chemical bonds in the two samples, suggesting that they have remained fairly well intact in the fossil sample, but also that some bonds (e.g. the C=O bond) have undergone some alteration.

Each will be described briefl y in turn. Identiﬁ cation of morphologically indistinct plant remains (chemosystematics) Th e recognition that distinct diff erences exist in the chemical composition of diff erent modern plant species has provided an opportunity to use chemical signals or ‘biomarkers’ from fossil plants as a tool in the identifi cation of morphologically indistinct plant remains. Th is fi eld of research can also be used to distinguish fossil plant organs, such as leaves and fruits, which are diffi cult to classify based on traditional morphological characters alone. Analyses of the chemical composition of waxes on the surface of modern plant cuticles (epicuticular waxes), for instance, have demonstrated that many genera and even species can be distinguished on the basis of the distribution of n-alkane and n-alkyl lipids in the waxes ( Dyson and Herbin, 1968 ; Mimura et al ., 1998 ; Skopura et al ., 1998 ; Pedentchouk et al ., 2008 ). An early example of using this approach was by Niklas ( 1976 ) who used the biochemical similarity of one of the earliest thalloid plant fossils, Parka (~400 Ma), to link it with the Chlorophyta (green algae). Th is involved scraping the carbonaceous fi lm of com- pression fossil from the rock and putting it through a series of chemical processes to extract organic, soluble compounds. Gas chromatography and high-resolution mass spectroscopy were then carried out on the residue for identifi cation of acid and ester mixtures. Th e presence or absence of particular lignins in samples of indistinguishable organic matter in sedimentary rocks can also be used to infer the proportion of gymnosperm to angiosperm in organic matter ( Figure 1.12 ). Th is in turn can be used to provide a picture, albeit a crude one, of the composition of fossil ecosystems, because the lignin of each group (angiosperms and gymnosperms) contains diagnostic chemical signatures, which can be readily identifi ed by geochemical analysis ( De Leeuw et al ., 1995 ). Indeed, much of the evidence for the fi rst appearance of the photosynthetic pathway in cyanobacteria, or the origin of life itself, comes from ‘chemical fossils’ of past metabolic activity ( Brocks et al ., 1999 , 2003 ). Biomolecules and the plant fossilization process (molecular taphonomy) Detailed studies of the chemical transformations and alterations that take place when biomolecules and resistant biomacromolecules are transferred from living plants to the fossil record provide important insights into the underlying process of plant fossilization.

One of the most common forms of leaf fossil in the geological record are coaly compressions, which are es- sentially made up of a cuticle surrounding a layer of coal that before fossilization consisted of mesophyll tissue. How can the cuticle be so well preserved when all of the rest of the leaf is turned to coal during fossilization? Initially it was thought that the presence of highly re- sistant biomacromolecules, such as cutan, was a necessary prerequisite to the diff erential preservation of cuticle ( Van Bergen et al ., 1995 ). Other research, however ( Mösle et al ., 1997 ), has demonstrated that rather it is chemical alteration of the macromolecules within the cu- ticle that occurs during the process of rock formation that is important ( Collinson et al ., 1998 ; Stankiewicz et al ., 1998a ). During rock formation, certain residues of macromolecules present in leaf cuticle are stabilized into a highly decay-resistant form and these aid the pres- ervation of plant fossil cuticle. Understanding this process helps to explain the extraordinary preservation of plant cuticle in rocks that are as old as 450 million years. Understanding the role of biomolecules in preservation potential also has other impor- tant implications in the interpretation of the plant fossil record ( Tegelaar et al ., 1991 ). For instance, does the absence of particular taxa from the fossil record imply that they had not yet evolved or were they absent because of a low preservation or fossilization potential? Water lilies ( Nymphae ), for example, possess a lignin-cellulose complex in their seed coats. As this is a very resistant biomacromolecule, it is believed to contribute to their seeds being com- mon in the fossil record ( Van Bergen et al ., 1996 ; Van Bergen et al ., 1997 ). Th e seed coats of another genus of water lily ( Nelumbo ), on the other hand, are devoid of lignin and the absence of this resistant biomacromolecule is believed to be the main reason for the absence of fossil Nelumbo seeds in older sediments. Th is is a nice example of how chemical analysis of two diff erent but related genera of water lilies helped to interpret their contrasting fossil records and make more informed hypotheses on the evolution of both taxa ( Van Bergen et al ., 1997 ). Biomarkers in the reconstruction of long-term environmental change Th e use of the fossil plant biomolecular record to reconstruct long-term environmental change has traditionally focused more on the biomarker record contained in ocean rather than terrestrial sediments. Th is is because marine records have a greater potential in terms of providing a long continuous record through geological time. One of many examples (for a review see De Leeuw et al ., 1995 ) of ancient biomolecules derived from plant material in marine sediments proving to be of particular use are lipids of prymnesiophyte algae. Laboratory results have revealed that many marine algae can biosynthetically tailor their lipid composition to match environmental conditions of stress, such as changing sea-sur- face temperatures, by changing the molecular composition of the lipid bilayer and thus maintaining the fl uidity of their membranes ( Harwood and Russell, 1984 ). Th ese marine phytoplankton tend to be extremely well preserved in marine sediments and their molecu- lar composition is readily measured. Comparison of the molecular composition of their ancient lipid bilayers with standards obtained from present-day populations in regions of 01-WillisandMcElwain-Chap01.indd 1701-WillisandMcElwain-Chap01.indd 17 11/28/13 10:29 AM11/28/13 10:29 AM 18 1 THE EVOLUTIONARY RECORD AND METHODS OF RECONSTRUCTION known oceanic temperatures has thus enabled temperature curves to be reconstructed over geological time ( Brassell et al ., 1986 ). Other examples of biomolecular ‘palaeoenvironmental indicators’ include chromans of algae and cyanobacteria as indicators of salinity changes through time and long chain n-alkanes as indicators of input by terrestrial vegetation into marine sediments. Certain fatty acids and triterpenes are also indicative of sea-grasses and mangrove-type vegetation respectively, whereas transformed biomacromolecules such as cutans, sporopollenin, and lignins may indicate either freshwater or terrestrial plant input to marine organic sediments ( De Leeuw et al ., 1995 ). Oft en, multiple analyses of many of these biomarkers can be used to infer the proximity of marine sediment from land, which is particularly useful in the reconstruction of palaeo-shore lines and past sea-level change. Stable carbon isotopes (δ 13 C) Isotopes are forms of elements that have the same atomic number but a diff erent atomic mass. Th ere are two stable isotopes of carbon, namely 13 C and 12 C, and the ratio of both iso- topes (the stable carbon isotopic composition (δ 13 C)) in plant tissue varies according to the biochemical pathway used by the plant for photosynthesis, the isotopic composition of the atmosphere and how the plant interacts physiologically with its environment. For example isotopic compositions of between −23‰ to −30‰ are recorded in plants with C3 photosyn- thetic pathways, –10‰ to –18‰ for plants with C4 photosynthetic pathways, and between –12‰ to –30‰ for plants with CAM photosynthesis ( Figure 1.13 ; see also Chapter 7 ). Th e isotopic composition of a plant organ appears to be remarkably resistant to decay. Th us, once plant material is preserved in the fossil record, the original plant carbon (such as coal) retains the approximate δ 13 C of the parent plant whole tissue, regardless of the fossil’s age, phylogeny, or burial history ( Degens, 1967 ). Jones and Chaloner ( 1991 ) , for example, have estimated that even high temperature charcoalifi cation does not drastically alter the stable carbon isotopic composition of original plant material. Diff erences in the stable carbon isotopic composition do occur, however, between diff erent tissues and biomolecules of the same plant. Th us, when utilizing fossil plant stable carbon isotopic ratios in long-term en- vironmental reconstructions, the same tissues (cuticle) or even biomacromolecules (lignin etc.) should ideally be used, rather than comparing results from diff erent tissues. Th e carbon isotopic composition of fossil plants has been used to investigate a range of diff erent environmental and biological phenomena from the fi rst appearance and evolution of diff erent photosynthetic pathways (C3, C4, and CAM; see Chapter 7 ) (e.g. ( Namburdiri et al ., 1978 ; Bocherens et al ., 1993 ; Sage, 2004 ) and changes in ecosystem composition (e.g. ( Cerling et al ., 1993 ), to long-term changes in the isotopic composition of the atmosphere (e.g. ( Arens and Jahren, 2000 ; Gröcke et al ., 1999 ; Hesselbo et al ., 2007 ) and in climate ( Nelson, 2012 ; Schubert et al ., 2012 ). Th ey have also been employed to detect changes in concentrations of both carbon dioxide (e.g. Cerling, 1992 ; Ekart et al ., 1999 ) and oxygen in ancient atmospheres (e.g. Karhu and Holland, 1996 ). Carbon isotope ratios can also pro- vide signals of the salinity or moisture content of the soils in which plants lived in the past before fossilization ( Nguyen Tu et al ., 1999 ). Temperature changes ( Beerling and Jolley, 1998 ) and physiological processes related to leaf gas exchange and photosynthesis have also been inferred from fossil plants δ 13 C ( McElwain et al ., 1999 ). Th e potential of stable carbon 01-WillisandMcElwain-Chap01.indd 1801-WillisandMcElwain-Chap01.indd 18 11/28/13 10:29 AM11/28/13 10:29 AM 191.3 METHODS OF RECONSTRUCTION isotopic investigations using fossil plants is therefore certainly very broad (for review see Bocherens et al ., 1993 ; Gröcke, 1998 ). Proxies recording environmental change What role has climate and atmospheric change played in plant species origination and extinc- tion events? In order to address this question, an understanding of how climate, environments, and atmospheric composition have changed through Earth history is necessary, and one of the only means of extracting such information from rocks and fossils is via the use of proxies. Proxies are biological, chemical, or physical indicators of past environmental conditions and their use in fossil plants has provided important qualitative and quantitative information on climate, atmosphere, and terrestrial landscapes over time. Th ere is a particularly rich record of Figure 1.13 (a) The ranges of δ 13 C values of modern C3, C4, and CAM plants.

Proxies have been developed to track the concentration of carbon dioxide ( Woodward, 1987 ; McElwain et al ., 2005 ; Kürschner et al ., 2008 ; Barclay et al ., 2010 ) and oxygen in the atmosphere ( Belcher and McElwain, 2008 ; Glasspool and Scott, 2010 ), mean annual temperature and precipitation ( Wolfe, 1978 ; Greenwood et al ., 2010 ; Peppe et al ., 2011 ), the elevation of past land surfaces ( McElwain, 2004 ; Kouwenberg et al ., 2007 ; Spicer et al ., 2003 ), fl uctuations in the amount of UV-B radiation received at the land surface ( Lomax et al ., 2008 ; Willis et al ., 2011 ), proximity to the shore and the amount of salt stress ( Bocherens et al ., 1993 ), and light intensity or position in the canopy ( Arens, 1997 ; Kürschner, 1997 ). 1.4 Phylogenetic trees Th roughout the book we discuss the evolution of plants as evidenced from the plant fossil record. However, we do so in the context of current understanding of the evolutionary his- tory of plants based on molecular and morphological phylogenetics. Morphological phylo- genetics use diff erences and similarities in morphological structures to propose hypotheses on the evolutionary relationships between extant and extinct organisms. Th is approach has the advantage of being able to incorporate morphological information from long extinct species preserved as fossils, thus providing a detailed view of plant evolution. However, mor- phological phylogenetics are limited by the diffi culty of interpreting whether a particular morphological trait is common to a number of organisms because of shared inheritance or because of adaptation to a similar environment; a combination of morphological and molec- ular information is therefore now viewed as essential in the construction of any phylogenetic tree. Molecular phylogenetics use diff erences and similarities in gene sequences of nuclear, mitochondrial, and chloroplast DNA of extant organisms to track their evolutionary history (phylogeny). In other words, the processes of organismal evolution are deduced from pat- terns of DNA variation. Over the past decade this fi eld has fl ourished and although detailed evolutionary relationships within families and genera are still being ironed out, there is now growing consensus on the overall shape and structure of the evolutionary tree of extant em- bryophytes (land plants) and their green algal ancestors (charophytes) (for review see Judd et al ., 2008 ). In each chapter we will therefore present the most recent and widely accepted evolutionary trees using these combined methods for the plant groups under discussion, which summarize the relationships between ancestral groups and their descendants. 1.5 Dating methods In order to provide a fi rm chronological framework in which to place plant fossils, a number of dating methods can be employed. Th e method chosen will be determined by both the approximate age range of the material to be dated and by the sedimentary matrix in which it is contained. Although radiocarbon dating is probably the most commonly cited dating technique, for the geological record it is of limited use, since it is only appropriate where the sample, or the matrix that it is contained within, is still in an organic state (i.e. not permin- eralized). Th e sample must also be less than approximately 50,000 years old. Methods more 01-WillisandMcElwain-Chap01.indd 2001-WillisandMcElwain-Chap01.indd 20 11/28/13 10:29 AM11/28/13 10:29 AM 211.5 DATING METHODS commonly used in the dating and correlating of the geological record therefore include ra- diometric dating, magnetostratigraphy, and biostratigraphy. Radiometric dating Radiometric dating uses the spontaneous decay of long-lived, naturally occurring ‘parent’ ra- dioactive isotopes into their ‘daughter’ products as a ‘geological clock’ ( Dalrymple, 1994 ). At the time of formation, parent isotopes are incorporated into various materials that make up the sample to be dated ( Aitken, 1998 ). Th e decay of parent to daughter isotopes (for example, 40 K decays to 40 Ar) happens regardless of changes in the physical or chemical environment. If the decay rate is known (oft en expressed as a half-life; e.g. 1.25 billion years in the case of 40 K to 40 Ar), then the daughter/parent ratio (e.g. 40 Ar/ 40 K) in the sample will give an indication of the time that has elapsed since the whole rock or mineral sample was formed. Other isotopes used in this type of age measurement include, for example, the decay of 238 U to 206 Pb and 40 Ar to 39 Ar ( Table 1.1 ). Diff erent isotopes have diff erent rates of decay, thus aff ecting their potential as a dating tool. Uranium-Lead (U-Pb) dating for example has an age range from 1 million to 4470 million yeas ago ( Dalrymple, 1994 ). Although it is diffi cult to date minerals younger than several thousands of years using radiometric dating (e.g. Renne et al ., 1997 ), the main disadvantage in using these techniques lies in the fact that the date relates to the formation age of the rock/mineral, rather than the death of the plant material or its incorporation into the sedimentary record. However, the date of sedimentary rocks can be established when they are overlain or intruded by igneous rock, or associated with tephra, and there are many examples where fossil assemblages have been dated this way. Geomagnetic polarity timescale Th e chronological position of the sample according to its palaeomagnetic signature is oft en used in conjunction with radiometric dating. Th roughout geological time there have been variations in the Earth’s geomagnetic fi eld, including polarity reversals where the magnetic North Pole has become the South Pole and vice versa ( Jacobs, 1994 ). Reversal records are preserved in both terrestrial and oceanic sediments, and the dating of these sedimentary Table 1.1 Decay rates of various naturally occurring radioactive isotopes used to determine the ages of rocks and minerals (after Dalrymple, 1994 ).

Magnetostratigraphy has been employed successfully as a correlation, and by association, a dating tool for numerous sedi- mentary sequences containing fossil assemblages ( Jacobs, 1994 ). Luminescence dating An alternative method for dating fossils contained within sedimentary sequences is luminescence dating, with an age range from decades to approximately 1 million years. Luminescence dating uses the radiation absorbed by mineral grains such as quartz and feldspar in sediments to measure geological time. Radiation comes from the decay of ura- nium, thorium, and potassium isotopes contained within the sediment, and from cosmic radiation. Radiation absorption causes displacement of electrons from atoms within the mineral grains and subsequent trapping of defects within the crystal lattice ( Aitken, 1990 ).

Th us, due to the cumulative eff ect, the number of electrons trapped represents the length of time since the sediment was buried. Laboratory heating or illumination of the sample returns trapped electrons to parent atoms and causes the sample to luminesce; greater radiation doses produce more light and the calibration of light emission against known laboratory radiation sources allows an estimate of the total absorbed radiation dose ( D e ) to be made. Th e amount of radiation dose absorbed per year ( D’ ) can be estimated from sediment chemistry (or by direct measurement), and the burial time is then D e / D’ (e.g. 10 units of radiation absorbed in total ( D e = 100), with 2 units absorbed per year ( D’ = 2), gives an age of 50 years). ‘Optically Stimulated Luminescence’ (OSL) and Th ermoluminescence (TL) methods have been developed extensively over the past 30 years ( see Wintle and Murray, 2006 for technical review). OSL (or ‘Optical dating’) methods, due to the use of only light- sensitive luminescence signals, are well-suited to dating the deposition of natural sedimentary material, for which the zeroing event is exposure to daylight during pre-burial sediment transport (less than a minute of full daylight exposure is adequate for resetting). Recent developments, including the use of specifi c signal components (e.g. Bailey et al ., 1997 ), single-grain measurements (e.g. Duller, 2008 ), theoretical background (e.g. Bailey, 2004 ), and dose rate modelling (e.g. Grine et al ., 2007 ) have improved the reliability and precision of the method considerably, even in cases where resetting of all grains is incomplete (e.g. Olley and Pietsch, 2004 ). Biological correlation Biological correlation, or biostratigraphy, is a method of relative rather than absolute dating and involves the use of presence/absence of index fossils within a sequence to provide an ap- proximation of its age. Th ese index fossils should be easily identifi able, have existed through a relatively short period of geologic time (less than 1 million years), be abundant and widely distributed geologically, and have lived in a range of diff erent sedimentary environments. If the date of the index fossil is known in one region, then the assumption is made that its occurrence in another locality indicates a deposit of similar age. Obviously there is great potential for circularity of argument in this method, because it will never be known if the index fossil existed in diff erent periods, if it is always assumed to be of one age. However, this method was extensively used before many of the above dating techniques were fully developed, and subsequent dating has indicated that many of the early correlations devel- oped using this method were correct ( Harland et al ., 1990 ). Molecular clocks Molecular clock analysis is a method used in molecular phylogenetics to estimate the time of divergence of taxa. Th e method is based on the assumption that if the rate of DNA se- quence evolution is suffi ciently constant, then it should be possible not only to determine the rate of nucleotide substitution for a particular species (i.e. number of nucleotide sub- stitutions/million years) but also, by comparing the genetic diff erence between two related 01-WillisandMcElwain-Chap01.indd 2301-WillisandMcElwain-Chap01.indd 23 11/28/13 10:29 AM11/28/13 10:29 AM 24 1 THE EVOLUTIONARY RECORD AND METHODS OF RECONSTRUCTION species, to calculate the length of time that has elapsed since they shared a common ancestor ( Figure 1.15 ) ( Zuckerkandl and Pauling, 1965 ). Th us the molecular clock adds a tempo- ral perspective to phylogenetic trees in demonstrating relatedness amongst species ( Lewin, 1997 ). Calibration of genetic distance as time, however, is diffi cult to determine. Usually, the number of substitutions that have occurred since a major recognizable event in the fos- sil record (such as the divergence/appearance of a specifi c group) is divided by the length of time that the group has been present in the fossil record, to calculate a substitution rate ( Langley and Fitch, 1974 ). However, this method of calibration is very approximate and appears to vary according to the DNA sequence measured (e.g. mitochondrial, nuclear, or chloroplast) ( Wolfe et al ., 1987 ; Futuyma, 1998 ), the methodology employed, and the source of data ( Bell et al ., 2005 ). More recent approaches relax the assumption that DNA sequence evolution is constant and allow for variation in substitution rates among diff erent lineages (Bell et al ., 2005). Th ese improved methods for estimating the age of origin of diff erent plant groups are more in line with fossil evidence. In the plant record, for example, early molecular clock estimates for the age of angiosperms were up to 100 million years older than the old- est known angiosperm fossil. Now, most studies using relaxed molecular clock approaches indicate that angiosperms originated sometime between 180 and 140 million years ago in the late Jurassic to early Cretaceous period ( Wikström et al ., 2001 ; Bell et al ., 2005 ). Th ese dates still predate the earliest known fossil angiosperm, but only by 10 to 50 million years, suggesting that the consistency and accuracy of molecular clock approaches have improved Figure 1.15 Accumulation of nucleotide substitutions over time, resulting in genetic differences between lineages.

More intriguingly perhaps, these revised age estimates for angiosperms suggest that the oldest known fossil representative of this hugely important lineage is yet to be discovered. Th roughout the book, recent estimates of divergence times based on molecular clocks will be compared with those based on fossil data. Summary 1. Plants are relatively simple organisms with a common list of basic needs (H 2 O, CO 2 , N, Mg, P, K, some trace elements, photons, plus various biochemical pathways necessary for photosynthesis). Th is list has remained almost unchanged from the fi rst land plants to the present. 2. Major boundaries in the geological timescale are based upon intervals of dramatic change apparent in the animal fossil record. If these boundaries had been devised according to the plant fossil record, their timing and placement would have been very diff erent. 3. Within the subject of evolution, there are two contrasting theories relating to the tim- ing of evolutionary change. Th e fi rst, originally proposed by Darwin ( 1859 ) , suggests that evolutionary change is gradual (termed ‘phyletic gradualism’) and results from increasing minute adaptation to other species and the environment. Th e alternative view point, fi rst proposed by Eldredge and Gould ( 1972 ) , suggests that evolutionary change is conserva- tive and only occurs in response to pulses of external driving forces. Th is model therefore expects evolution to occur in short pulses of speciation that are tied in with some major environmental perturbation, interspersed by long intervals of no change (stasis). 4. Th ere are three main types of plant fossil in the geological record: compression/ impression fossils; permineralized fossils; and unaltered plant remains. Th e products of these diff erent types of fossilization process result in a plant fossil record ranging from biomolecular compounds through to disarticulated plant parts (e.g. pollen, spores, leaves, phytoliths) up to and including whole fossil forests and ecosystems. 5. An important point to take into account when assessing the plant fossil record is the impact of diff erential productivity, preservation, and decay. Understanding these tapho- nomic processes can radically alter the interpretation of a fossil assemblage. 6. Th e use of plant biomacromolecular remains (‘biomarkers’) contained in fossil sedi- mentary sequences has provided an important tool in: a) identifi cation of morphologi- cally indistinct fossil plant remains; b) understanding the stages that occur in the plant fossilization process; and c) reconstructing palaeoenvironmental change. 7. Stable carbon isotopes are another important plant-based marker in the fossil record. Key features that can be determined using this method include determination of the evolution and fi rst appearance of photosynthetic pathways in plants (C3, C4, and CAM) and reconstructing long-term changes in climate and the isotopic composition of the atmosphere. 8. Morphological and molecular phylogenies have greatly enhanced the understanding of evolutionary relationships as determined from the plant fossil record. Morphological 01-WillisandMcElwain-Chap01.indd 2501-WillisandMcElwain-Chap01.indd 25 11/28/13 10:29 AM11/28/13 10:29 AM 26 1 THE EVOLUTIONARY RECORD AND METHODS OF RECONSTRUCTION phylogenies use morphological traits to hypothesize on the evolutionary relationships be- tween extant (living) and extinct (fossil) plants. Molecular phylogenies, in comparison, use diff erences and similarities in the gene sequences of nuclear, mitochondrial, and chloro- plast DNA of extant (and sometimes sub-fossil) plant material. 9. Th e most useful dating techniques for providing a detailed chronology for the plant fossil record include those based on dating the biological material (i.e. radiocarbon dat- ing, molecular clocks, and biological correlation) and those that date the sediments that contain the fossil plants (i.e. radiometric dating, optical luminescence data, and geo- magnetic polarity measurements). 01-WillisandMcElwain-Chap01.indd 2601-WillisandMcElwain-Chap01.indd 26 11/28/13 10:29 AM11/28/13 10:29 AM 2 Earliest forms of plant life Th e Earth was formed approximately 4600 million years ago and within 800 million years, cellular life had evolved. Palaeoenvironmental reconstructions suggest that global tempera- ture and the composition of the earliest atmosphere, ocean, and land would have provided a challenging combination of environmental extremes for the onset of biological evolution. However, evolutionary turnover occurred between 630–541 million years such that by 541 million years ago (Cambrian) an array of multicellular organisms, both plant and animal, had evolved. Th is chapter outlines the patterns of environmental change and biological evo- lution in the fi rst 4 billion years of Earth history and describes the processes that led to the development of the fi rst forms of multicellular plant life. 2.1 The earliest environments Almost 4 billion years of geological time precedes the evolution of the fi rst multicellular land-dwelling plants. Th is immensely long era in geological time, known as the Precam- brian, is divided into three aeons: the Hadean, which is the time from the formation of the Solar System and early accretion of planet Earth (~4600 Ma), the Archean, or ‘time of the beginning of life’, between ~4000 Ma to 2500 Ma, and the Proterozoic, from ~2500 Ma to 541 Ma. Geological evidence indicates that the continental crust started to form by ~4200 Ma and that by ~1100 Ma a large, single, lens-shaped body had amassed ( Goodwin, 1991 ; Condie, 1997 ; Li et al. , 2008 ). Th is supercontinent has been named ‘Rodinia’ and is thought to have been located around the equatorial belt, in roughly the same position as present- day Africa ( Briggs, 1995 ). Initial splitting up of Rodinia occurred from approximately 850 Ma ( Figure 2.1 ), resulting in a number of separate microcontinents predominantly at lower latitude by 700 Ma ( Li et al ., 2008 ; Hoff man and Li, 2009 ) ( Figure 2.2 ). Th e early continental crust would have been thin and extremely hot due to heat fl ow from the mantle. Estimates of Earth’s heat production in the early Archaean (~4000–3500 Ma) suggest that it was two or three times greater than present ( Goodwin, 1991 ). By 3000 Ma it is thought that the heat had subsided suffi ciently to allow the development of a continen- tal crust, up to 40 km in thickness. Th is crust was composed of igneous rock, weathered 02-WillisandMcElwain-Chap02.indd 2702-WillisandMcElwain-Chap02.indd 27 11/28/13 12:44 PM11/28/13 12:44 PM 28 Figure 2.1 Diagrammatic representation of major continental development and movement in the Earth’s early history.

Although the continental crust was hot, calculations indicate that endogenic heat was not an important factor in controlling surface air temperatures ( Worsley et al ., 1986 ). Th e sun was also considerably less luminous than present with calculations indicating that it would have been fainter by a factor of 25–30 per cent ( Sagan and Chyba, 1997 ). Global air temperatures in these early environments should therefore have been low enough for water to be frozen and global glaciation to prevail on Earth. Instead geological evidence suggests that water was present in liquid form ( Nisbet and Sleep, 2001 ). Another factor must there- fore have been responsible for warming these early environments and this is most likely to have been a massive global greenhouse eff ect. In these early environments there would have been extremely high levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and methane (CH 4 ) from volcanic degassing. Estimates of early concentrations of atmospheric CO 2 , for example, range between 30 to 100 times higher than present ( Sheldon, 2006 ; Figure 2.3 ). Th ese high atmospheric concentrations combined with other greenhouse gases would have blocked outgoing long wave radiation, promoting greenhouse warming ( Kasting et al ., 1983 ; Figure 2.3 History of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) based on estimates from palaeo-CO 2 proxies (A–C) and models (D–F) between 4500 and 500 Ma.

Climatic models indicate that such high levels of greenhouse gases could have been responsible for global temperatures between 30 and 50 °C in these early environ- ments (3500–3200 Ma) ( Lowe, 1994 ). Such temperatures would have been high enough to sustain liquid water on Earth. In contrast to the high levels of carbon dioxide, early atmospheric oxygen (O 2 ) was extremely low ( Figure 2.4 ). Some estimates suggest that before 2450 Ma, the O 2 content of the air accounted for <0.01 per cent of total atmospheric composition, and was probably a major limiting factor for organic evolution ( Holland, 1994 ). One of the most restrictive factors associated with extremely low levels of oxygen would have been the lack of an ozone layer, and therefore no protection for terrestrial organisms from incoming solar radiation and UV. However, various sedimentary deposits that require free oxygen for their forma- tion become apparent in the geological record between ~2450–2220 Ma (early Proterozoic) including red-beds (sandstones and shales with red iron oxide) ( Eriksson and Cheney, 1992 ) and highly oxidized palaeosols ( Holland and Beukes, 1990 ; Bekker et al. , 2004 ). Th e evidence from these records is therefore taken to indicate that atmospheric O 2 rose signifi - cantly during this time. Estimates suggest, nevertheless, that O 2 was still considerably lower than present with values of ~2.1 per cent O 2 compared with modern atmospheric levels of 21 per cent ( Planavsky et al ., 2011 ) ( Figure 2.4 ). Other gases contributing to the overall composition of the early atmosphere included hydrogen, hydrogen cyanide, formaldehyde, and hydrogen sulphide. Th ese would have been present in trace amounts, resulting from vol- canic outgassing, photochemical reactions in the atmosphere, and cometary infall ( Deamer, 1993 ; Chang, 1994 ; Hayes, 1994 ).

Temperature and composition of the early oceans would have been strongly infl uenced by mantle outgassing ( Holland, 1984 ), with estimates suggest- ing that they were warm (between 80 and 100 °C) and contained high concentrations of ferrous irons, dissolved CO 2 , and bicarbonate, with perhaps a pH as low as 6.0 ( Lowe, 1994 ). For the fi rst 2.5 billion years of Earth history the oceans also contained little oxygen (anoxic) ( Rasmussen et al ., 2012 ); only around 541 million years ago, at the beginning of the Phanerozoic, is there evidence for a fully oxygenated ocean ( Figure 2.4 ). 2.2 Accumulation of organic material and formation of the ﬁ rst cell A precondition to any form of biological evolution requires liquid water, and the accumula- tion and synthesis of organic polymers including nucleic acids and proteins ( Bada, 2004 ). A membrane to contain the macromolecules is also required. Th ere are at least two contrasting theories as to how organic matter accumulated in the prebiotic environment and became contained within a cell wall: terrestrial accretion and cometary infall. Th e oldest and most widely cited theory is that of terrestrial accretion. Th is theory, fi rst proposed by Miller in 1953, is based on the principle that, under laboratory conditions, when gases such as hydrogen, carbon dioxide, methane, and ammonia are heated with water, and energized by electrical discharge for at least 24 hours, approximately half the carbon originally present in the methane gas will be converted into amino acids, sugars, and other organic molecules, including purines and pyrimidines (required to make nucleotides). Amino acids and nucleotides can associate to form polymers, including polypeptides (pro- teins) and polynucleotides (RNA and DNA) ( Miller, 1992 ), thus forming the fi rst building blocks of the cell. An alternative theory is that the fi rst organic material on Earth came from other planets and entered the Earth’s atmosphere via meteoritic input. Th is idea was originally viewed as better suited to the realms of science fi ction. However, there is increasing evidence to sup- port the theory ( McKay et al ., 1996 ) with Mars and Venus as likely candidates to provide the earliest cellular material to Earth ( Melosh, 1998 , 2003 ). It has been estimated for example that ~500 kg of Martian rocks up to 10 cm in diameter fall on Earth each year ( Melosh, 1994 ). Some calculations have suggested that between ~4700–3500 Ma, when there would have been a heavy meteoritic bombardment, organics could have accumulated at a rate of 10 6 –10 7 kg/year ( Chyba et al ., 1990 ), resulting in ‘a layer of organic material several centime- tres deep spread over the surface of the earth’ ( Deamer, 1993 , p. 15). Analyses of present-day meteorites (carbonaceous chondrites) indicate that they typically contain numerous nano-sized carbon-rich grains ( Garvie and Buseck, 2004 ), hydrocarbons, amino acids, carbon, hydrogen cyanide, and amphiphilic molecules; all the building materi- als necessary for the fi rst cell ( Figure 2.5 ). Th ere is, however, still considerable debate as to which process is more probable ( Hedges and Kumar, 2009b ). Critics of the terrestrial ac- cretion mechanism suggest that although such processes may occur under laboratory con- ditions, there is no conceivable environmental equivalent of a closed glass fl ask in which such reactions could occur. Critics of the meteoritic theory argue that the combination of 02-WillisandMcElwain-Chap02.indd 3102-WillisandMcElwain-Chap02.indd 31 11/28/13 12:44 PM11/28/13 12:44 PM 32 2 EARLIEST FORMS OF PLANT LIFE radiation, heat, and impact shock would have resulted in organic materials in these rocks becoming destroyed before reaching the surface of the globe. For the fi rst cells to form from accumulated organic material (by whichever method), however, there also needed to be development of an outer cell membrane (cell wall) and concentration of the organic compounds. An extremely important environment for both processes to occur would therefore have been shallow tidal pools, where cycles of solar heat- ing and cooling, combined with tidal wetting and drying, would have provided the necessary conditions for concentration and molecular self-assembly ( Figure 2.6 ). Containment of the macromolecules probably resulted from the presence of amphiphilic molecules. Th ese molecules have one part that is hydrophobic (i.e. water insoluble) and the other part hydrophilic (i.e. water soluble). In water, amphiphilic molecules tend to aggre- gate to form bilayers (with the water-soluble parts aligning) creating small, closed vesicles, the aqueous contents of which are isolated from the external medium. On drying, these bilayers fuse into multilayers and any other molecules present become trapped between the layers and incorporated into the vesicles on rehydration ( Deamer et al. 1994 ; Mon- nard and Deamer, 2011 ). It is envisaged therefore that cycles of solar heating and cooling, combined with tidal wetting and drying, would have provided the necessary conditions for concentration and molecular self-assembly, leading to the formation of the fi rst cell. Th e amphiphile vesicles also have selective permeability, thus allowing the passive diff usion of smaller substrate molecules yet containment of large metabolic products, thereby leading to concentration of organic material and accumulation of larger molecules ( Monnard and Deamer, 2011 ). It is envisaged, therefore, that wetting and drying cycles in the prebiotic tidal pools may well have provided an ideal environment for formation of an early protocell ( Figure 2.6 ).

Th is theory, which is closely associated with the processes of meteoritic and cometary infall, is that the evolution of the fi rst cells took place on another planet, possibly Mars. Th ese cells were then carried to Earth via meteoritic bombardment ( Sleep and Zahnle, 1998 ). Again, it is acknowledged that most cells would have perished in space, but it is also noted that ‘it only takes one cell to infect a planet’ ( Nisbet and Sleep, 2001 ). Interestingly, experiments to examine the survival of bacteria (e.g. Bacillus subtilis —a rod-shaped bacterium found in soils) ( Mileikowsky et al ., 2000 ) and some rock-inhabiting microbial communities (e.g. the cyanobacterium Chroococcidiopis ) ( Horneck et al ., 2008 ) during a hypothetical space journey indicate that both would have withstood the stress of an impact ejection. 2.3 The ﬁ rst prokaryotes: the geological evidence Th e fi rst 2500 million years of life on Earth consisted of prokaryotic cells less than 1 mm in size ( Carroll, 2001 ). Of all the organisms presently on the Earth, prokaryotes are the simplest in structure, smallest physically, and most abundant in terms of number of indi- viduals ( Raven et al ., 1992 ). Th ere are currently 10,000 species of prokaryotes recognized on Earth ( Battistuzzi and Hedges, 2009 ; Hedges and Kumar, 2009a ) demonstrating incredible spatial diversity and environmental tolerance. Species of prokaryotes are found, for example, Figure 2.6 Formation of outer cell membrane and containment of the macromolecules within the cell. It is suggested that an extremely important environment for development of the outer cell membrane and the concentration of organic compounds to form more complex molecules would have been shallow tidal pools.

Th ere are also species that can survive at temperatures of 121 ° C, higher than any other organism, and species that can live at a pH as low as zero ( Battistuzzi and Hedges, 2009 ). Prokaryotes range between approximately 1 and 10 μm in size, are single celled (although many types have cells joined together within a mucilaginous sheath), lack an organized nucleus surrounded by a nuclear envelope, and reproduce by binary fi ssion (i.e. each cell increases in size and divides into two). Prokaryotes also tend to have one of three basic cell shapes ( Figure 2.7 ): a straight rod shape (bacilli); a spherical shape (cocci); or a long, coiled shape (spirilli). Evidence for some or all of these characteristic features (shape, size, arrangement of orga- nelles, and method of reproduction) is apparent in the earliest fossil records, suggesting that by 3500 million years ago, a complex system of prokaryotes had developed on planet Earth ( Knoll, 1992 ; Schopf, 2006a , b ; Schopf et al. , 2007 ; Butterfi eld, 2007 , 2009 ). Evidence from stromatolites Stromatolites, some dating as far back as 3500 Ma (early Archaean), are found in localities ranging from Spitsbergen and central East Greenland to South Africa, Australia, and parts of Antarctica (reviewed in Schopf, 2006b ). Th ey are composed of numerous alternating light and dark layers of sediment ( Figure 2.8 ) and are thought to represent the trace fossils of ancient microbial mat communities. One of the most widely cited examples to explain stromatolite formation is the stromatolite beds presently accreting in Shark Bay on the west coast of Aus- tralia. Here, laminated cushion-like structures can be seen in the intertidal zone ( Figure 2.9 ) Figure 2.7 (a) A schematic illustration of the structure of a generalized prokaryotic cell.

Th ese layers are formed when cyanobacterial mats spread over the ocean substrate and trap and bind a layer of sediment particles. A layer of calcium carbonate forms on top due to microbially mediated precipitation, and the light-requiring microorgan- isms respond by growing upwards. A subsequent layer of sediment is trapped by the newly formed cyanobacteria, and thus through time, a layered structure will develop ( Figure 2.10 ).

Such structures appear to form today only in hypersaline environments that exclude the grazing invertebrates that now inhibit their formation in other marine settings. Th eir Precambrian equivalents had no such grazers to contend with ( Hedges and Kumar, 2009a ). Th e distribution and composition of stromatolite communities are strongly determined by ecological factors, including temperature, pH, salinity and water potential, light inten- sity, and the ability for anaerobic growth. Subtle diff erences in these environmental factors determine the microbial communities present and this, in turn, aff ects the shape of the stro- matolite ( Schopf, 2006a , b ). In a 10 km expanse of 3430 million year old stromatolite beds in Australia (Strelly Poll Chert), for example, seven distinct stromatolite types have been found ( Allwood et al ., 2006 ). Th e most common of these are cone-shaped stromatolites (conophy- ton) ( Figure 2.11 ). Broadly similar structures have been found forming in the hot springs of the Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, USA ( Walter, 1977 ) where the thermal waters have temperatures of between 32 and 59 °C and pH values of 7–9. Th e predominant micro- organisms responsible for the formation of these ‘conophytons’ in the Yellowstone springs have been identifi ed as fi lamentous cyanobacteria (also known as blue-green algae, despite Figure 2.11 Fossil conophyton beds in the Mesoproterozoic Bangemall Group, Western Australia (1625–1000 Ma); scale bar in cm. Photograph courtesy of N. J. Butterﬁ eld. 02-WillisandMcElwain-Chap02.indd 3702-WillisandMcElwain-Chap02.indd 37 11/28/13 12:44 PM11/28/13 12:44 PM 38 2 EARLIEST FORMS OF PLANT LIFE the fact that they do not belong to any algal group—most recently these are referred to as ‘blue-greens’), but other photosynthetic fi lamentous bacteria are also present (e.g. Chloro- fl exus ). Th e variety of stromatolite types apparent in these fossil deposits indicates a reef-like build-up was occurring in the shallow waters and possibly one of the earliest ‘fossil’ ecosys- tems in Earth’s history ( Allwood et al. , 2006 ). Th e presence and shape of the fossil stromatolite beds dating back to the Proterozoic have therefore been used to infer a number of features. Th ese include the early presence of prokaryotes, the probable types of microbial communities represented, evidence of early prokaryotic metabolism (especially photosynthesis) ( Tice and Lowe, 2004 ), and the type of environment in which they were formed ( Nisbet and Sleep, 2002 ). Information from fossil stromatolite beds, however, is mostly inferential since they rarely contain direct evidence of the microorganisms responsible for their accretion. However, the fossil records are now so widespread and abundant, and their biological interpretation so well supported by studies of extant communities ( Knoll, 2003 ; Schopf et al. , 2005 ; Allwood et al ., 2006 ; Schopf et al ., 2007 ), that there is little doubt that nearly all are the result of early biological ecosystems ( Schopf, 2006a , b ; Schopf, 2009 ). Th ere is also increasing evidence from the ancient biomolecular record to support the presence of these very early ecosystems dating back to ~3800 Ma ( Mojzsis et al ., 1996 ; McKeegan et al ., 2007 ). Evidence from cherts and shales Stromatolite beds are usually calcareous. Whilst this appears to be an excellent preserva- tional medium for the large-scale morphological features described above, it would appear that the growth of carbonate grains tends to destroy the fossil morphological detail of the microbes responsible for the mat building. Other sedimentary deposits must therefore be sought in order to determine the earliest microbes on Earth. Th is detail has been found to date in cherts and shales and in particular from exceptional deposits in Western Australia (Pilbara Bock) and South Africa (Barberton Greenstone Belt) ( Schopf et al ., 1987 , 2007 ). Both of these sequences date to between ~3500–3000 Ma. Th e abundant fossil microor- ganisms obtained from these cherts and shales and others indicate a suite of characteristic shapes very similar to those seen in extant prokaryotes. Th ese include small rod-shaped bodies, coccoidal-shaped, narrow, broad, and tubular fi laments ( Figure 2.7 ) ( Schopf et al ., 2007 ; Butterfi eld, 2009 ). Structurally there are also remarkable similarities, including evi- dence for distinct cell wall and cell division patterns. For example, there are many fossil specimens that have been preserved while in a state of cell enlargement and division, sug- gesting binary fi ssion (e.g. Knoll and Barghoorn, 1977 ; Knoll, 1985 ). Th e fact that these early fossil morphologies and cell division patterns show very close similarities to extant prokary- otes indicates remarkable evolutionary stasis, suggesting that these organisms are eff ectively ‘living fossils’ with a 2000 Ma record ( Schopf, 1994 ; Butterfi eld, 2007 ). Probably some of the most interesting of these early prokaryotes are those that bear re- markable morphological similarity to extant photoautotrophic cyanobacteria (also referred to as oxygen-producing blue-greens). Th eir presence from ~1900 Ma ( Tomitani et al ., 2006 ) indicates organisms capable of oxygen-producing photosynthesis as far back as this time but possibly much earlier if the evidence from stromatolite beds is also taken into account ( Tice and Lowe, 2004 ). 02-WillisandMcElwain-Chap02.indd 3802-WillisandMcElwain-Chap02.indd 38 11/28/13 12:44 PM11/28/13 12:44 PM 392.4 EVOLUTION OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS Younger Proterozoic deposits (between 2500 and 541 Ma) indicate an increasing mor- phological diversity of prokaryotic life. It is estimated that by the Cambrian (541 Ma) there were at least 122 taxa present in approximately 40 diff erent biotas ( Knoll, 1992 ; Knoll, 2012 ). One of the best examples of increased morphological diversity is from the Gunfl int Forma- tion in southern Ontario, Canada. Here a number of microorganisms have been identifi ed in thin sections from black carbonaceous chert dating to ~2100 Ma ( Barghoorn and Tyler, 1965 ; Schopf et al ., 2002 ). From these sediments at least 12 species have been recognized, including a number that are comparable to extant prokaryotes. Th ese include: a fi lamentous form named Animikiea , which in structure and cell organization is nearly morphologically identical to the extant fi lamentous cyanobacterium Lyngbya or Oscillatoria ; a type named Gunfl intia , the general morphological make-up (cell contents and structure) of which is similar to that of extant species of the chemosynthetic, iron-forming bacterium Crenothrix ; and a multi-fi lament microorganism named Eoastrion , which is thought to be related to an extant metal-oxidizing, budding bacterium. Th us, many diff erent types of microorganism, morphologically similar to extant prokaryotes, are recognizable extremely early on in the fossil record. Characteristic features of these early prokaryotes probably included an ability to ferment, to withstand hot temperatures (thermophily), and to respire without the use of oxygen (anaerobic res- piration) ( Dyer and Obar, 1994 ; Nisbet and Sleep, 2002 ). All would have been extremely important requisites in the earliest environments. From a plant evolutionary viewpoint, however, the most interesting of these numerous examples of early microorganisms must be those resembling photosynthetic bacteria and, in particular, the cyanobacteria, as they played a key part in the evolution of photosynthesis. Structurally extant photosynthetic cyanobacteria possess chlorophyll a , together with carotenoids and phycobilins, layers of photosynthetic thylakoids, and ribosomes ( Raven et al ., 1992 ). It is therefore probable that the early cyanobacterial ancestors had a similar suite of cellular contents and were capable of photosynthesis. 2.4 Evolution of photosynthesis Th e evolution of photosynthesis was perhaps one of the most important innovations in life on planet Earth and certainly the singularly most important precursor to the evolution of green plants ( Figure 2.12 ). Photosynthesis uses light energy from the sun, water, and carbon dioxide to synthesize complex sugars. Th e splitting of the water molecule in photosynthe- sis releases oxygen as a by-product. It is widely accepted, therefore, that the evolution of oxygen-producing (oxygenic) photosynthesis contributed, together with geological pro- cesses, to the oxygenation of Earth’s early atmosphere and oceans ( Figure 2.4 ). Th ere are various hypotheses as to the evolution of the photosynthetic pathway (for reviews see Xiong et al ., 2000 ; Nisbet and Sleep, 2002 ). One of the most plausible is that the evolution of photo- synthesis paralleled the evolution of the structural mats (stromatolites) ( Nisbet and Fowler, 1999 ; Nisbet and Sleep, 2001 ). Th us, as organisms grew in the more productive but more exposed uppermost layers of the microbial mats, new forms evolved that had the biochemi- cal pathways to utilize the energy of the sunlight and the electrons from the water to convert atmospheric CO 2 into organic compounds (i.e. photosynthesis). 02-WillisandMcElwain-Chap02.indd 3902-WillisandMcElwain-Chap02.indd 39 11/28/13 12:44 PM11/28/13 12:44 PM 40 2 EARLIEST FORMS OF PLANT LIFE Th e earliest fossil evidence for oxygenic photosynthesis is indirect and comes from stable carbon isotopic compositions of stromatolites and other Archaean aged sediments as early as 3500 Ma ( Nisbet and Sleep, 2002 ). Photosynthetic organisms preferentially take up the light isotope of carbon ( 12 C) and discriminate against the heavier isotope ( 13 C). Th ese early stromatolites and sediments are isotopically light, indicating that the process of photosyn- thesis had evolved. Th e earliest photosynthesizers, however, were non-oxygen producing (anoxygenic) and likely inhabited areas close to hydrothermal vents using hydrogen, sul- phur ( Wacey et al. , 2011 ), or hydrogen sulphide as electron donors ( Nisbet and Sleep, 2002 ). Sandstone deposits from the 3400 Ma Strelley Pool Formation, Western Australia, provide a good example of the earliest known sulphur-metabolizing bacterial communities ( Wacey et al ., 2011 ). Only later in the fossil record, with the evolution of cyanobacteria, were cells capable of using water as the electron donor, i.e. a process that is similar to the vast majority of green algae and land plants today. Th is innovation would have enabled these organisms to explore vast unoccupied niches away from hydrothermal vent systems, as liquid water was freely available in these early environments ( Nisbet and Sleep, 2002 ). Th e earliest fossil evidence for cyanobacteria capable of oxygenic photosynthesis comes from fossil biomark- ers known as 2a-methylhopanes, which have been recovered from stromatolites dating to 2700 Ma ( Summons et al. , 1999 ).

It is sug- gested, therefore, that the evolution of this protein was an important prerequisite to the evolution of photosynthesis in early cyanobacteria. Today, the enzyme RUBISCO is found in many non-photosynthetic bacteria. It is likely, therefore, that the original function of this hugely important enzyme to life on Earth was somewhat diff erent in the earliest prokary- otes which were non-photosynthetic. Only later was RUBISCO recruited to a new role as a photo synthetic enzyme within cyanobacteria and later all photosynthetic eukaryotes. 2.5 Evolution of the eukaryotes Eukaryotes diff er from prokaryotes in that they have a membrane-bound nucleus in which the DNA is contained, organelles including mitochondria, integrated multicellularity, and sexual reproduction (sometimes) ( Figure 2.13 ). Th ey constitute the three major groups of multicellular organisms (plants, animals, and fungi), along with many groups of the Protista, including species of red, green, and brown algae ( Hedges and Kumar, 2009b ) ( Figure 2.14 ). Because of the diversity and importance of eukaryotic organisms to life on Earth, it is oft en stated that the evolution of eukaryotes was one of the most important events in the history of life ( Knoll, 1992 ). Geological evidence Evidence for eukaryotes (from fossil organisms and ancient biomolecules) suggests that they were probably present on Earth from as early as 2700 Ma ( Brocks et al ., 1999 ; Summons et al ., 1999 ; Dutkiewicz et al. , 2006 ; Knoll et al. , 2006 ) although the earliest fossil records are dated to around 1800 Ma. Four fossil records of early eukaryotes of particular interest to the evolu- tion of plants include the oldest recorded alga Grypania ( Han and Runnegar, 1992 ), re-dated Figure 2.13 Cross section of a eukaryotic cell (redrawn from Lipps, 1993b ).

Green algae Grypania One of the oldest recorded eukaryotes is the alga Grypania , which was discovered in the banded iron formations of northern Michigan ( Han and Runnegar, 1992 ) and dated to approximately 1870 Ma ( Schneider et al ., 2002 ). Th is fossil, which is a coiled cylindrical organism, 0.5 m in length and 2 mm in diameter, has a number of morphological char- acteristics, including its large size, morphological complexity, and structural rigidity, to suggest that it represents a giant unicellular alga ( Figure 2.15 ). A suggested modern-day analogue is Acetabularia , which is a dasycladalean (green algae) capable of oxygenic photosynthesis ( Runnegar, 1994 ). Some have questioned that this fossil is the earliest known eukaryotic cell based on a lack of suffi cient morphological detail ( Samuelsson and Butterfi eld, 2001 ), highlighting the diffi culty of piecing together these early stages in the evolution of eukaryotic life.

Th ese rocks, dated to approximately 1200 Ma, contain fossils that are extremely close in morphological detail to the extant red algal genus Bangia . Because of the exceptional preservation of the fossils in this formation (they are permineralized), it has been possible to cut thin sections both transverse and per- pendicular to the bedding plane. Perpendicular cross sections have revealed unbranched, uniserate fi laments, 15–45 mm in diameter and up to 2 cm long ( Figure 2.16 ). Th e fi laments appear to consist of stacked disc-shaped cells enclosed in a relatively transparent envelop- ing sheath and, in some sheaths, constrictions are apparent ( Figure 2.17 ) ( Butterfi eld et al . 1990 ; Butterfi eld, 2000 ). Examination of these fi laments in transverse section has revealed Figure 2.15 Photograph of Grypania . Reproduced from Han, T-M. and Runnegar, B.

With this level of morphological detail, the case for arguing that these fossils are closely related to the extant Bangia is extremely convincing. Extant Bangia have a fi lamentous form, a similar size, and are composed of stacked cells within an almost trans- parent sheath ( Figure 2.18 b). Restrictions are oft en apparent in the sheath, and in transverse cross section of the Bangia fi lament there are eight wedge-shaped cells ( Butterfi eld, 2007 ). Green algae Cladophora Early multicellular green algae have been found in 800–700 million year old shale deposits from the Svanbergfj ellet Formation on Spitsbergen ( Butterfi eld et al ., 1994 ). In these de- posits there is strong morphological evidence to suggest the early presence of green algae comparable to the extant Cladophorales, which belong to an early branching group of green algae called Chlorophytes ( Figure 2.12 ). Th e morphological evidence to link them to this group includes extensive branching fi lamentous thalli (up to 1 cm in height) composed of large cylindrical cells (50–800 mm in diameter), which are attached to adjacent cells by thickened septal plates ( Figure 2.19 a) ( Butterfi eld et al ., 1988 ). When compared to extant species of cladophoralean (Ulvophyaceae) green algae (e.g. Cladophora , Figure 2.19 b) there is a remarkable similarity. It is interesting to note that present-day classifi cations based on molecular phylogenetics divide the green algae (over 7000 species) into seven evolutionary groups of various sizes ( Figure 2.12 ). Th e Ulvophyceae, which include the cladophoralean green algae, are one of Figure 2.17 Perpendicular cross section of fossil bangiacean red algal ﬁ laments has revealed stacked disc- shaped cells in a relatively transparent enveloping sheath (scale bar, 25 μm), indicating close morphological similarity to modern Bangiomorpha pubescens .

Th ey contain a number of species that form ‘algal mats’ in tropical reef areas. Geological evidence has therefore provided many pieces of the jigsaw in understanding the earliest evolution of life on Earth ( Figure 2.20 ). It gives a fi rst estimation of what was around and when. However, further insights into the evolutionary relationship between the early prokaryotes and the eukaryotes have been gained not by looking at the fossil record, but by examining extant forms at both a structural and a molecular level. Comparison of earliest fossil eukaryotes with extant forms Structural comparisons Certain species of extant photosynthetic cyanobacteria bear a remarkable similarity, both in terms of intracellular structure and molecular make-up, to chloroplasts ( Cattolico, 1986 ). Th ese similarities have led to the generally accepted theory that the early cyanobacteria may have been instrumental in evolution of the fi rst eukaryotic cells. It is suggested that the cyanobacterium became incorporated into a pre-existing eukaryotic cell as a result of endosymbiosis ( Margulis, 1970 , 1981 ). By transferral of genetic material to the nucleus, cyanobacteria became an integral part of the eukaryotic cell as plastids (e.g. chloroplasts) ( Figure 2.21 ). Molecular studies have supported this theory (for review see Tekle et al. , 2009 ) by demonstrating, for example, that the DNA in plastids is more closely related to that of cyanobacteria than the host eukaryotic nuclear DNA. Plastids in glaucophyte algae (single- celled algal group) have retained the cyanobacterial cell wall whereas it has been lost in both red and green algae.

In extant purple non-sulphur bacteria, the morphological, biochemical, and metabolic features indicate a strong resemblance to mitochondria. Endosymbiosis of a purple non-sulphur bacterium is therefore suggested as another probable process that led to the formation of an integrated and functioning eukaryotic cell ( Deamer, 1993 ; Deamer et al ., 1994 ; Dyer and Obar, 1994 ) ( Figure 2.21 ). Figure 2.21 One of a number of proposed theories on the origin of the eukaryotic cell. This theory, also known as the two-merger model, proposes that endosymbiosis of a eubacterium by an archaebacterium around 2700 Ma resulted in a eukaryotic cell with a nucleus. Later merger with another eubacterium resulted in a eukaryotic cell with mitochondria around 2000 Ma. The origin of plastids such as chloroplasts in green plants and red plastids in red algae is hypothesized to result from a single endosymbiotic event around 1600 Ma with a coccoid cyanobacterium.

Th is is in good agreement with the earliest fossil evidence of eukaryotes with plastids, which date to 1200 Ma ( Butterfi eld et al ., 1990 ). Recent genomic analysis of the early diverging green algae Cyanophora paradoxa has revealed that this endosymbiotic event occurred once at the root of all green plants ( Price et al. , 2012 ). Th ere are many other examples where plastids have been laterally transferred from one eukaryotic lineage to another. For example, plastids used for photosynthesis in modern day brown algae and yellow-green algae (Chromatists) likely originate from an- cient endosymbiosis events of eukaryotic cells in the green plant lineage ( Figure 2.21 ). Th ese events are termed ‘secondary endosymbiosis events’ where one eukaryote engulfed another and kept its plastids with all their photosynthetic capabilities ( Baldauf, 2003 ). Molecular comparison As species diverge from a common ancestor, they accumulate genetic mutations (usually substitutions in the genetic code), resulting in species becoming more genetically diff erent over time ( Lewin, 1997 ). Th us, by comparing the genetic diff erence between two groups, it is possible not only to relate them to a common ancestor but also to calculate the amount of time that has elapsed since they diverged from that ancestor. Using evidence attained from the geological record as to which groups to examine (i.e. those fi rst present), a number of molecular studies have been carried out in recent years to determine both the probable evo- lutionary pathway to, and time of divergence of, the earliest eukaryotes (e.g. Woese et al ., 1990 ; Schlegel, 1994 ; Sidow and Th omas, 1994 ; Woese, 1994 ; Baldauf, 2003 ; Bhattacharya et al ., 2009 ). By comparing base sequences of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) among a large selec- tion of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, as well as a number of protein sequences, a number of interesting molecular relationships have emerged. Th ese molecular analyses have upset the traditional two-kingdom classifi cation of eukaryotes and prokaryotes and are sup- ported by more recent comparative genomic techniques ( Gribaldo and Brochier-Armanet, 2006 ). Th e main conclusions drawn from these molecular studies to date are as follows ( Figure 2.21 , 2.22 ). i) Prokaryotes have a deep phylogenetic split between archaebacteria and eubacteria Molecular evidence has established that there are two distinct groups of bacteria that are as genetically distinct from each other as each is from the eukaryotes ( Woese et al ., 1990 ; Baldauf, 2003 ; Gribaldo and Brochier-Armanet, 2006 ). Th ese two groups have been named the archaebacteria (ancient bacteria) and eubacteria (true bacteria). Th e archaebacteria include the extreme halophiles (salt-tolerant bacteria), the methanogens, and the extreme thermophilic (heat tolerant) sulphur-metabolizing bacteria (eocytes). Th e eubacteria in- clude cyanobacteria and purple sulphur bacteria ( Figure 2.22 ). To date there is direct body fossil evidence in the geological record for numerous cyanobacteria (eubacteria) but not as yet any direct evidence of archaebacteria. However, ultra-light carbon isotope signatures from ancient sedimentary carbonates indicate that the onset of methane cycling occurred from at least as early as approximately 2800 million years ago ( Hayes, 1994 ), thus providing indirect evidence for the early presence of at least the methanogens. In addition, evidence of sulphate reduction at ~3500–3400 Ma ( Shen et al ., 2001 ; Wacey et al ., 2011 ) suggests that 02-WillisandMcElwain-Chap02.indd 4802-WillisandMcElwain-Chap02.indd 48 11/28/13 12:44 PM11/28/13 12:44 PM 492.5 EVOLUTION OF THE EUKARYOTES bacterial sulphate reducers, similar to those found in present-day anoxic marine sediments, may have been present by this time ( Michaelis et al ., 2002 ). ii) Eukaryotes bear a speciﬁ c phylogenetic relationship to archaebacteria Molecular evidence indicates that the eukaryotes are phylogenetically closer to the archaebac- teria than the eubacteria ( Figure 2.14 , 2.22 ). Th at is, the archaebacteria either separated early from the eubacterial lineage and/or the eukaryotic lineage branched from the archaebacte- ria aft er they separated from the eubacteria ( Lipps, 1993b ). Further molecular phylogenetic work on the archaebacteria has also revealed that it is probably the eocytes (that is the extreme thermophilic, mostly sulphur-metabolizing bacteria) that are the closest bacterial relatives to eukaryotes ( Rivera and Lake, 1992 ). Th us, rather than the eukaryotes sharing a common an- cestor with all three main groups in the archaebacteria (the halophiles, the methanogens, and the eocytes), the eukaryotes only share a most recent and common ancestor with the eocytes. iii) Eukaryotes are an ancient group almost as old as the prokaryotes Using a molecular clock based on DNA sequences, dating of the split between the three major lineages (eukaryotes, eubacteria, and archaebacteria) suggests that diversifi cation occurred at around 3500 million years ago (or earlier) ( Knoll, 1992 ; Dyer and Obar, 1994 ; Baldauf et al ., 2004 ). Th e earliest eukaryotes evolved at, or very shortly following, the split of the archaebacteria and eubacteria ( Baldauf et al ., 2004 ). It was once considered that the earliest eukaryotes, that is those that are in the lowermost branches of the evolutionary tree and therefore most similar genetically to the archaebacteria, were simple, mostly unicellular microorganisms that have no mitochondria and are confi ned to oxygen-free environments. Th is idea has been overturned by the most recent ‘time trees of eukaryotes’, which date the major branching events of all major eukaryote groups to a geologically narrow window of between 1400 Ma and 900 Ma ( Bhattacharya et al ., 2009 ). Th e earliest branching events were among the morphologically more complex multicellular evolutionary lines leading to green Figure 2.22 Molecular phylogenetic split of the domains: the primary kingdoms.

Hence there is evidence for a relatively rapid radiation of all eukaryotes in the Mesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic at a time when the super continent Rodinia was fi rst forming and later breaking up ( Figure 2.2 ), when atmospheric oxygen levels were still only 2 per cent of present atmospheric levels ( Figure 2.4 ) and CO 2 levels were between 10 and 100 times present ( Figure 2.3 ). Th e temporal pattern of eukaryotic evolution raises some interesting questions as to the rate and process of evolution of life on Earth. In particular, the fact that the major evolution- ary groups (animals, fungi, plants) appear to radiate at similar times implies a rapid burst of evolution around 1300, 1200, and 900 Ma ( Bhattacharya et al ., 2009 ). Th is, along with other lines of evidence, has led to the suggestion that the major epochs in eukaryotic evolution are in some way causally linked to signifi cant geological events in the early period of Earth’s history (e.g. Schopf, 1994 ). 2.6 Possible triggering mechanisms of eukaryotic evolution A number of researchers have suggested that the combined geological/molecular record demonstrates a general trend of episodic increases in biological diversity ( Knoll, 1992 ) through the Archean and Proterozoic (~3500–541 Ma) ( Knoll and Lipps, 1993 ; Dyer and Obar, 1994 ; Knoll, 1994a ; Riding, 1994 ; Nisbet and Sleep, 2001 ). Six major biological events that are relevant to the evolution of land plants include: (i) the origin of life on Earth and diversifi cation of anaerobic archaebacteria and eubacteria sometime before 3500 Ma; (ii) the origin of photosynthetic organisms around ~3500 Ma; (iii) the appearance of organisms capable of aerobic metabolism and cellular acquisition of the organelles mitochondria and, later, chloroplasts, aft er 2700 Ma; (iv) the appearance of complex eukaryotic organisms in the geological record from approximately 1870 Ma; (v) the large increase in diversity of organisms and radiation of acritarchs—a group of organic-walled microfossils, the majority of which are thought to represent reproductive cysts of green algae or algae cysts ( Mendelson, 1993 ), from approximately 1000 Ma ( Knoll, 1994b ); (vi) the large increase in diversity of planktonic algae from approximately 541 Ma ( Knoll, 1992 , 1994b ). Th e question therefore arises as to whether it is possible to relate these periods of evolu- tionary change to evidence in the geological record for environmental change. A number of tentative links have been suggested for events (i) and (ii), including decreasing meteoritic bombardment between approximately 4000 and 3800 Ma and rapid accretion of continental crust at around 2700 Ma. However, more detailed consideration of the environmental con- ditions associated with tectonic activity and also climatic conditions associated with periods of glaciations ( Knoll, 1994a ) have been given for the changes apparent from 1000 Ma (in particular rising levels of atmospheric oxygen resulting from increased burial of organic carbon and due to photosynthetic oxygen production). 02-WillisandMcElwain-Chap02.indd 5002-WillisandMcElwain-Chap02.indd 50 11/28/13 12:44 PM11/28/13 12:44 PM 512.6 POSSIBLE TRIGGERING MECHANISMS OF EUKARYOTIC EVOLUTION Rising levels of atmospheric oxygen It has long been suggested that a rise in atmospheric oxygen could have been one of the triggering mechanisms responsible for the appearance of complex eukaryotes ( Knoll, 1994a , b , 1996 ). Increased atmospheric oxygen levels would have led to the formation of an ozone layer around 2400 Ma, which would have provided protection from UV-B radiation. Eukaryotes are more sensitive to UV-B than are prokaryotes, suggesting that an ozone layer was an important prerequisite to their origin. In order to examine a possible causal link, it is necessary to have a means of measuring levels of atmospheric oxygen other than by increases in the number of aerobic organisms, which involves a circularity of argument. Th ere are numerous geological and geochemi- cal indicators of past atmospheric oxygen concentration that have collectively improved understanding of the evolution of the atmosphere in the fi rst 4 billion years of Earth history ( Figure 2.23 ). Between 4500 and 2450 Ma the atmosphere and oceans were more or less anoxic, at less than 0.01 per cent of present atmospheric levels. Indirect evidence for such trace levels of oxygen includes the presence of detrital uranite, siderite, and pyrite, shallow water sediments that are highly reduced and non-oxidized fossil soils. 2400 Ma is known as the great oxygenation event ( Holland, 2002 ). From this time onwards atmospheric O 2 levels climbed. Between 2450 and ~550 Ma, O 2 levels ranged between 1 per cent and 10 per cent of present atmospheric levels and the surface oceans became oxygenated for the fi rst time in Earth history. However, they remained highly stratifi ed with anoxic deep waters and euxinic (stagnant and/or anaerobic) intermediate waters until ~550 Ma ( Rasmussen et al ., 2012 ). Another step-change occurred around 550 Ma with evidence for fully oxygenated ocean waters and it is estimated that atmospheric O 2 levels reached between 25 per cent ( Bergman et al ., 2004 ) and 100 per cent ( Berner, 2006 ) of present atmospheric levels. Sedimentological evidence for increased O 2 aft er the great oxygenation event includes oxi- dized shallow water sediments, CaSO 4 -rich evaporates, and red beds, all indicating that pro- cesses requiring an oxygenated atmosphere were in place. Another example of a proxy for atmospheric oxygen comes from isotopic analysis of carbonate carbon in sedimentary rocks that can give an indication of times of burial of organic carbon. When organic carbon is buried, it eff ectively becomes shielded from oxidation, causing the oxygen that was hitherto bound to it as CO 2 to become ‘free’ to enrich the atmosphere ( Knoll, 1996 ). Results suggest that episodic increases in the burial of organic carbon occurred between ~2200 and 1800 Ma and 1100 and 700 Ma ( Des Marais et al ., 1992 ) ( Figure 2.23 ). An additional oxygen proxy is based on meas- urement of the isotopic composition of biogenic sedimentary sulphides that can be used to de- tect the process of sulphide production and whether it occurred in conditions with or without the presence of oxygen. Comparison of deposits dated between 1050 and 640 Ma with younger deposits (i.e. <541 million years ago) indicates a change in the process of sulphide production, from one driven within anaerobic conditions to one within aerobic conditions ( Canfi eld and Teske, 1996 ). Both lines of evidence therefore point to increasing availability of atmospheric oxygen between ~2450 and 541 Ma, and the former to episodic bursts of increase. When comparing the timing of origin of major prokaryotic and eukaryotic groups in the Precambrian with the overall trends in atmospheric oxygen, the most striking observa- tion is the coincidence of the origin of the fi rst multicellular animals and land plants with a rise in atmospheric oxygen to near present levels ( Figure 2.23 ). Atmospheric oxygen is vital for aerobic respiration in all eukaryotic cells, as O 2 is used as the fi nal electron acceptor in 02-WillisandMcElwain-Chap02.indd 5102-WillisandMcElwain-Chap02.indd 51 11/28/13 12:44 PM11/28/13 12:44 PM 52 2 EARLIEST FORMS OF PLANT LIFE respiration: the aerobic metabolism of glucose to generate ATP. In plants and animals, respi- ration fuels growth and development, repair, and reproduction. Th e importance of relatively higher atmospheric O 2 for the evolution of animals has long been recognized ( Knoll, 1994a ); however, its importance for land plant evolution has generally been overlooked. For instance, reproduction in land plants is a very energy demanding process and experimental studies have shown that reproduction is severely hampered at O 2 concentrations below 15 per cent and completely fails below 2.5 per cent ( Porterfi eld et al ., 1999 ). Th e concentration of O 2 in the atmosphere becomes particularly critical as body size increases. In the case of plants, studies have shown that steep O 2 gradients can occur in metabolically active or bulky plant Figure 2.23 Evolution of the early biosphere in the context of major changes in atmospheric oxygen concentration. (a) Simpliﬁ ed history of atmospheric oxygen concentration over the last 4 billion years from Planavsky et al . ( 2011 ) . (b) Simpliﬁ ed history of the oxygenation of Earth’s oceans from Rasmussen et al . ( 2012 ) and Planavsky et al . ( 2011 ) . (c) Timing of major evolutionary events from varied sources as follows: timing of origin of ozone layer is inferred to coincide with great oxygenation event around 2400 Ma (reviewed in Catling and Claire, 2005 ). Timing of likely but equivocal origin of prokaryotes (shaded grey bar) is 3700 Ma based on 13 C depleted carbon indicating the presence of life in sedimentary rocks from West Greenland ( Rosing, 1999 ). The date of the earliest unequivocal prokaryotic cell in the fossil record is 3400 Ma ( Wacey et al. , 2011 ). Likely origin (shaded grey) of eukaryotes is 1870 Ma ( Grypania , Han and Runnegar, 1992 ; Figure 2.15 ). Earliest unequivocal fossil eukaryotic cells are 1200 Ma ( Butterﬁ eld, 2000 ). The earliest indirect evidence for cyanobacteria capable of oxygen producing photosynthesis is 2900 Ma ( Nisbet and Sleep, 2001 ); however, indirect evidence for O 2 producing photosynthesis dates back to 3500 Ma ( Nisbet and Sleep, 2002 ). Earliest multicellular fossilized red algae is 1200 Ma ( Butterﬁ eld, 2000 ), multicellular green algae is 750 Ma ( Butterﬁ eld et al. , 1994 ), and land plants (embryophytes) is 450 Ma ( Wellman et al. , 2003 ).

It is therefore likely that more structurally complex and larger eukaryotes such as animals (Metazoa) and land plants (embryophytes) could not evolve until atmospheric O 2 passed a critical threshold around 590 Ma. Changing environmental conditions associated with glaciations Atmospheric CO 2 levels decreased signifi cantly during the break-up of the supercontinent Rodinia ( Riding, 2006 ), plunging the planet towards its fi rst geographically extensive glacia- tion by 716 Ma ( Macdonald et al ., 2010 ) ( Figure 2.3 ). Th e exact duration of the glacial interval is unknown, but isotopic data indicate at least two major intervals of extreme cold: from ~716 Ma to ~670 Ma, known as the Sturtian glaciation, and from ~650 Ma to 635 Ma, referred to as the Marinoan glaciation. Th is interval is oft en referred to as ‘Snowball Earth’ ( Kirschvink, 1992 ; Hoff man et al. , 1998 ) because evidence for ice is recorded at low elevation in the low latitudes. Th e fi nal glaciation of the Proterozoic (~1000–541 Ma), the Varanger ice age, took place between approximately 610 and 590 Ma ( Harland et al ., 1990 ; Briggs, 1995 ). Th ere is some evidence to suggest that these glacial episodes infl uenced patterns of origination and extinction of green algae and single celled groups. For example, during the Varanger ice age, more acritarch extinctions occurred than originations, resulting in a decline in overall spe- cies number (75 per cent reduction). Following the ice age, there was a large increase in spe- cies number and many new and highly ornamented acritarchs appeared. A tentative link has therefore been suggested between the acritarchs and environmental/oceanographic changes that accompanied the end of the Varanger glaciation ( Knoll and Lipps, 1993 ; Knoll, 1994a , b ). Although just two examples are provided above, there are many other suggestions in the literature of bursts of evolutionary activity occurring at or around the same time as sig- nifi cant geological events in this early period of Earth history (e.g. Knoll, 1992 ; Knoll and Lipps, 1993 ; Schopf, 1994 ; Beerling and Butterfi eld, 2012 ). However, it is also highly probable that in these early environments there would have been spiralling ecological relationships ( Knoll, 1991 , 1994a ; Butterfi eld, 2009 ; Knoll, 2012 ). It has been argued that the rapid radia- tion among eukaryotic groups aft er ~1660 Ma can most likely be attributed to the evolution of plastids such as chloroplasts ( Figure 2.21 ), which increased productivity at the base of the newly evolving food chains and allowed great expansion of ecological niches in the oceans and freshwater environments ( Nisbet and Sleep, 2002 ; Hedges et al ., 2006 ). Without a doubt, these would also have had a major impact on species diversity and number, resulting in the development of a complex marine ecosystem of plants and animals by the beginning of the Cambrian period, 541 Ma. Summary 1. Continental crust started to form on Earth from approximately 4200 Ma, and by 1100 million years ago a large landmass called Rodinia had developed. 2. Th e earliest terrestrial environments were harsh, with global temperatures estimated at between 30 and 50 °C and levels of atmospheric oxygen at less than 0.01 per cent of 02-WillisandMcElwain-Chap02.indd 5302-WillisandMcElwain-Chap02.indd 53 11/28/13 12:44 PM11/28/13 12:44 PM 54 2 EARLIEST FORMS OF PLANT LIFE present-day levels of 21 per cent. As a result, there would have been no ozone layer, and high levels of atmospheric CO 2 and CH 4 would have created a strong greenhouse eff ect. 3. Oceans formed early in Earth history (between 4400 and 3900 Ma) by condensation of atmospheric water vapour. Estimates suggest that the earliest oceans were warm (between 80 and 100 °C) and fairly acidic. 4. Prokaryotic organisms are present in the fossil record from as early as 3500 Ma and eukaryotic organisms from approximately >1800 Ma. 5. Th ree geological records of early eukaryotes of particular interest to the evolution of plants are those of Grypania , fossil bangiacean red algae, and cladophoralean green algae. 6. Molecular and structural examination of extant forms of the earliest types of prokaryotes and eukaryotes apparent in the fossil record indicate a possible evolutionary pathway between the two. 7. Eukaryotic cells (containing a membrane-bound nucleus and organelles including mitochondria and chloroplasts) were probably created by endosymbiosis of certain prokaryotes, photosynthetic cyanobacteria, and purple non-sulphur bacteria. Th ey have close structural and molecular similarities to chloroplasts and mitochondria, respectively. 8. Evidence from both the geological and molecular records suggests that both prokaryotic and eukaryotic evolution occurred in relatively rapid bursts. Tentative links have been implied between major epochs in early eukaryotic evolution and times of major climatic and environmental changes, such as during times of increasing atmospheric O 2 and during glaciations. 02-WillisandMcElwain-Chap02.indd 5402-WillisandMcElwain-Chap02.indd 54 11/28/13 12:44 PM11/28/13 12:44 PM 3 The colonization of land Th e colonization of the land by plants was one of the most signifi cant evolutionary events in the history of the planet. Before colonization could occur, however, major changes were necessary, both to the environment and to early plants, in order to enable growth outside of an aquatic environment. By the middle Ordovician (∼470 Ma) plants that were permanently adapted to a terrestrial or water-defi cient habitat (land plants) had evolved. Th is chapter examines the environmental changes leading up to and during terrestrialization, the fos- sil evidence for changes in plant morphology that enabled land dwelling, and the possible evolutionary pathways from the earliest aquatic plants to land plants. It concludes with a consideration of the global biogeographical distribution of the earliest land plants and an assessment of how they changed the Earth system. 3.1 Environmental changes during the Cambrian and Ordovician (541–443 Ma) Land surfaces were available for colonization by plants from an early point in the history of multicellular life ( see Section 2.1 ). However, other essential environmental prerequisites were still developing. Th ese included the formation of sizeable and stable near-shore en- vironments, the development of soils, and the amelioration of atmospheric and climatic conditions suitable for terrestrial plant survival. Formation of new sizeable and stable near-shore environments Th e Cambrian and Ordovician were periods of relatively intense tectonic activity, result- ing in reorganization of the continental plates. Th e supercontinent Rodinia fragmented and there was a collision of East Gondwana with West Gondwana ( Figure 3.1 ). Th is was followed by the rotation and collision of West Gondwana relative to Laurasia ( Rogers, 1996 ; Condie and Sloan, 1998 ; Murphy and Nance, 2008 ; Murphy et al ., 2009 ), resulting in the assembly of the supercontinent, Pangea ( Figure 3.2 ). 03-WillisandMcElwain-Chap03.indd 5503-WillisandMcElwain-Chap03.indd 55 11/28/13 1:05 PM11/28/13 1:05 PM 56 3 THE COLONIZATION OF LAND During this time interval there were also dramatic sea-level changes ( Haq and Schutter, 2008 ; Miller et al ., 2005 ). Initially sea levels were rising in response both to mantle upwelling, associated with the tectonic activity, and the melting of ice sheets that had developed during ice ages in the late Proterozoic (three glacial episodes have been recognized: Sturtian (726– 660 Ma), Marinoan (655–635 Ma) and Edicarian (∼582–580 Ma) glaciations ( Hoff man and Li, 2009 )). Widespread fl ooding of the continental plates during this time created large areas of shallow continental shelf ( Briggs, 1995 ; Miller et al ., 2005 ), with estimates suggesting that more than two-thirds of North America was covered by a shallow sea ( Crowley and North, Figure 3.1 Diagrammatic representation of major continental development and movement in Earth’s history during the Cambrian and Ordovician (∼541–443 Ma).

Th is was followed by another period of glaciation (estimated to have lasted for as lit- tle as 500,000 years) around 443 million years ago (end of the Ordovician) ( Finnegan et al ., 2011 ) ( Figure 3.3 ), which led to a dramatic reduction in global sea-levels by as much as 60 m ( Haq and Schutter, 2008 ). In the marine animal record a severe extinction event lasting 03-WillisandMcElwain-Chap03.indd 5703-WillisandMcElwain-Chap03.indd 57 11/28/13 1:05 PM11/28/13 1:05 PM 58 3 THE COLONIZATION OF LAND 1–2 million years coincides with this glacial event ( Sheehan, 2001 ). In the plant record it is around this time that there is the fi rst unequivocal evidence for the colonization of the land by terrestrial plants ( see Section 3.2 ). Formation of soils Th e bare rock surfaces of the earliest terrestrial environments would have had no humic material or biologically available mineral elements (e.g. N, P, Fe, S), a factor that would have posed serious limitations to plant colonization. However, geological evidence in- dicates that basalt derived palaeo-soils were forming as far back as 2700 Ma ( Ohmoto, 1996 ; Neaman et al ., 2005 ) and that by 440 Ma (early Silurian) well-established soil pro- fi les, with evidence of in situ oxidation of organic matter and deep-burrowing organisms, had developed ( Retallack, 1985 , 1986 , 2001 ; Yapp and Poths, 1992 ). Various processes (biological and non-biological) are thought to have played important roles in the forma- tion of these fi rst soils, including atmospheric elemental input and weathering by acid rain, and organic acids produced by early microbial organisms such as cyanobacteria and the earliest land plants. One of the most important mechanisms responsible for enriching these early soils with Fe and P was probably weathering of parent material, a process in which the early prokary- otic and eukaryotic organisms would have been extremely important. In extant systems, organic acids secreted from microbes, including cyanobacteria, non-photosynthetic bacte- ria, and eukaryotic algae, play a signifi cant role in the process of breaking down rock mate- rial and releasing Fe and P ( Jones, 1998 ). For example, the chelation of Fe (III) from rocks is carried out by specifi c organic molecules called siderophores. Siderophores are secreted by prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Th ese siderophores, containing the Fe (III), are then taken up by other organisms and their breakdown results in the release of Fe ( Raven, 1995 ; Neaman et al ., 2005 ). Extant prokaryotes commonly secrete organic acids and large quantities of Fe can be mobilized from basalts even under anoxic conditions ( Neaman et al ., 2005 ). Th us even prior to the evolution of land plants (embryophytes), microbial crusts teeming with prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms could have operated the full range of Fe and P acquisition processes necessary to break down bare rock and to form the earliest thin soils. Th e addition of N to these early soils would also have been important. In the earliest environments inorganic nitrogen would have been available from both planetary accre- tion and volcanic degassing. In order to convert this into biologically available forms (e.g. nitrates, NO 3 ), it is probable that, as in present day environments, two key mecha- nisms were responsible: lightning strikes and biological fi xation by nitrogen-fi xing bac- teria ( Raven and Yin, 1998 ). With the evolution of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria (e.g. phototrophic purple bacteria; see Section 2.5 ), it is estimated that nitrogen fi xation would have increased dramatically. Estimates suggest that with the evolution of these bacteria, the resulting fl ux of nutrients through the biosphere would have increased by a factor of up to 100 ( Canfi eld et al ., 2006 ). Th e ability to fi x N 2 therefore probably evolved early in Earth’s history and it is likely that in these early environments the most limiting factor would have been the availability of inorganic carbon rather than nitrogen fi xation ( Canfi eld et al ., 2010 ). 03-WillisandMcElwain-Chap03.indd 5803-WillisandMcElwain-Chap03.indd 58 11/28/13 1:05 PM11/28/13 1:05 PM 593.1 ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES DURING THE CAMBRIAN AND ORDOVICIAN Another factor that probably contributed to early soil development is related to fossil evi- dence for an early appearance of lichens. Lichens, which are a symbiotic association between a fungus and a nitrogen-fi xing cyanobacterium, have now been found in deposits dating back to at least 550 million years old ( Taylor et al ., 1995 ; Yuan et al ., 2005 ). In South China, for example, lichen-like fossils, consisting of fi lamentous hyphae closely associated with coc- coidal cyanobacteria, have been found preserved in deposits dating to between 551 and 635 million years old ( Yuan et al ., 2005 ). Th ese fossils indicate that fungi developed symbi- otic partnerships with photoautotrophs before the evolution of land plants. Th e importance of these early lichens must be viewed, as in extant groups, in their ability to colonize and weather bare rock, thus contributing to the formation of soils. Development of suitable climatic and atmospheric conditions One of the most striking diff erences between the environmental conditions of the modern Earth and those that prevailed during the Ordovician period (485 to 443 Ma) is in the composition of the atmosphere. In our modern atmosphere there is 535 times more oxy- gen than carbon dioxide. Model estimates based on biogeochemical cycles of carbon and sulphur indicate that there was between 8 to 35 times more O 2 than CO 2 in the Ordovi- cian atmosphere. Th us, the evolution of land plants from an aquatic ancestor took place in the context of an atmosphere very rich in carbon dioxide, between 8 and 15 times higher than present ( Berner and Kothavala, 2001 ; Bergman et al ., 2004 ), and exceptionally low in oxygen: only 4 per cent ( Bergman et al ., 2004 ) ( Figure 3.3 , 3.4 ). If the model estimates for Figure 3.4 A record of atmospheric oxygen concentration over the past 500 Ma based on model estimates of Bergman et al .

Th e ozone layer would also have been much thinner if O 2 concentration was merely 4 per cent, perhaps one of the primary limitations to the terrestrialization process? High atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases such as CO 2 did not lead to ex- tremely elevated global temperatures in the Ordovician mainly because the strength of solar radiation was signifi cantly less than today according to the ‘faint young sun hypothesis’ ( see Chapter 2 ). A global average surface temperature of approximately 21 °C is estimated for the early Ordovician, which is similar to today ( Lenton et al ., 2012 ). In fact, throughout the Ordovician global temperatures are thought to have become cooler, with results from stud- ies examining the sensitivity of the global carbon cycle to both geological and biological factors suggesting that atmospheric CO 2 may have dropped to 8 times higher than present around 460 Ma, triggering a ∼6 °C drop in global temperature and glaciation ( Lenton et al ., 2012 ). Palaeotemperature proxies for tropical sea surface temperatures support a cooling trend through the Ordovician, reaching temperature regimes similar to present day tropical waters ( Trotter et al ., 2008 ) by the Mid Ordovician (∼470 Ma). Steeper temperature gradi- ents from equator to pole developed as global average temperature cooled, especially across the large supercontinental land mass of Gondwana ( Crowley and North, 1991 ; Trotter et al ., 2008 ; Vandenbroucke et al ., 2009 ); however, there is little evidence to suggest that they were more extreme than the gradients experienced across the globe today ( Herrmann et al ., 2004 ) ( Figure 3.5 ). Coastal areas were likely monsoonal whereas aridity may have been more preva- lent in the continental interiors ( Crowley and North, 1991 ; Graham, 1993 ). 03-WillisandMcElwain-Chap03.indd 6003-WillisandMcElwain-Chap03.indd 60 11/28/13 1:05 PM11/28/13 1:05 PM 613.2 FOSSIL EVIDENCE FOR PLANT TERRESTRIALIZATION Figure 3.6 (a) Spores in tetrahedral arrangement; (b) composition of the tetrahedral spore; (c) single spores with distinctive trilete Y-shaped marking. (a) (b) (c) 3.2 Fossil evidence for plant terrestrialization In parallel to changing environmental conditions, major evolutionary changes in plant structure, shape, life cycle, and reproduction were necessary in order for plants to survive in a terrestrial environment. From the late Ordovician to early Silurian (∼475–430 Ma), evi- dence starts to emerge in the plant fossil record for the development of specialized cells for water and nutrient transport, various measures to protect against desiccation, mechanical support, and a reproductive mode that did not depend predominantly upon external water ( Gensel, 2008 ; Kenrick et al ., 2012 ; Niklas and Kutschera, 2009 ). Th ese morphological and life cycle changes were essential prerequisites for land dwelling by plants. Reduction of dependence on water for reproduction Some of the earliest plant records are from spores visible in the geological record at ∼475 Ma (Upper Ordovician) ( Wellman et al ., 2003 ). Th ey appear fi rst in the fossil record as single envelope enclosed spores (monads) or arranged combinations of two (dyads) or four spores (tetrads) also enclosed within an envelope, the function of which remains unknown ( Gray et al ., 1982 ; Wellman and Gray, 2000 ; Wellman, 2010 ; Kenrick et al ., 2012 ). Later in the Silurian, around 430 million years ago, single naked spores with no protective envelope and spores with a distinctive Y shaped (trilete) mark start to appear in the fossil record. Th e trilete mark is thought to be indicative of a scar left from the time when four spores were attached to each other in a pyramidal arrangement. When they came apart to form single spores, a trilete mark was created at their central joining position ( Figure 3.6 , 3.7 ). Th e tetrahedral arrangement in the oldest spores and the trilete marking on the slightly younger spores are both thought to be indicative of meiotic division within land plants, whereby a diploid cell divides by meiosis to produce four haploid spores. Th e key biological distinction between these diff erent fossil spore types is whether the four spores remain closely packed together and dispersed as tetrads or whether the tetrads fall apart and the spores are dispersed singly as trilete spores. Tetrads today are predominantly found in non-vascular plants such as mosses, liverworts, and hornworts, whereas trilete spores are typically produced by plants with vas- cular tissue such as ferns and lycophytes. 03-WillisandMcElwain-Chap03.indd 6103-WillisandMcElwain-Chap03.indd 61 11/28/13 1:05 PM11/28/13 1:05 PM 62 3 THE COLONIZATION OF LAND Th e signifi cance of these early trilete spores in the fossil record is that many especially those occurring in the record from ∼430 Ma, probably represent the fi rst evidence for the elaboration of the sporophyte (spore producing) phase in the plant life cycle and a transition from predominantly non-vascular to vascular plants ( Traverse, 1988a ; Gensel, 2008 ; Ken- rick et al ., 2012 ) ( Figure 3.7 ). However, to fully appreciate the importance of the develop- ment of a more complex sporophyte phase to land dwelling, it is necessary to fi rst examine the life cycle of their aquatic green algal ancestors. Modiﬁ cation of the life cycle Many algal groups are known to reproduce both asexually and sexually. In some green algae (e.g. Ulvophyaceae) and all land plants, sexual reproduction involves an alternation of two phases or generations, namely a diploid sporophyte phase and a haploid gametophyte phase ( Figure 3.8 ). In the gametophyte phase, male and female gametes (each gamete containing a single set of chromosomes) are released from the gametophyte. Th e male gametes swim to the female and fuse, producing diploid zygotes that contain double sets of chromosomes. Figure 3.7 First appearance and relative abundances of different fossil spore types in the geological record indicating the timing and sequence of terrestrialization by land plants (embryophytes). The marked change- over in spore types approximately 440 Ma is interpreted as an ecological shift from an early vegetation dominated by bryophytes (non-vascular plants) to one dominated by tracheophytes (vascular plants).

When mature, the sporophyte undergoes meiotic division to form haploid spores and these are released from the plant to grow into gametophytes. Th us the alternating cycle (gametophyte/sporophyte) is complete ( Figure 3.8 ). Most extant green algal groups including the closest relative to land plants (Charales) had a much simpler life cycle involving only one dominant multicellular generation, termed haplobiontic, rather than an alternation between two as found in land plants (termed diplobiontic), and the mature stage of Charales’ life cycle is a haploid game- tophyte with no multicellular sporophyte stage ( Figure 3.8 a). Land plants (embryophytes) therefore evolved greater developmental fl exibility regarding their life cycle compared with their green algal ancestors ( Niklas and Kutschera, 2009 ) ( Figure 3.8 ). Th e adaptive advantages of a diplobiontic life cycle for terrestrialization were as fol- lows. Firstly, embryophytes evolved the capacity to retain the fertilized egg (zygote) within the protective structure of the gametophyte. Th is would have aff orded a greater degree of 03-WillisandMcElwain-Chap03.indd 6303-WillisandMcElwain-Chap03.indd 63 11/28/13 1:05 PM11/28/13 1:05 PM 64 3 THE COLONIZATION OF LAND protection to the developing embryo and is the reason why all land plants are called em- bryophytes. Secondly, the evolution of a multicellular sporophyte in land plants with the capability to produce hundreds and thousands of spores would have increased the potential to propagate the next generation in instances where sexual reproduction events within the gametophyte were rare. Th is, according to Niklas and Kutschera ( 2009 ) , would have been particularly adaptive in the earliest terrestrial environments as a rainfall event leading to a single successful sexual fusion of egg and sperm in the gametophyte would result in the de- velopment of a sporophyte producing hundreds of spores to propagate the next generation. Contrast this example with a terrestrial green alga having a haplobiotic life cycle. Th e same rain event and sexual fusion would only lead to a single new plant rather than potentially hundreds or thousands in an embryophyte in the same habitat. Th irdly, having two multicel- lular stages within the life cycle off ered the potential to occupy two very diff erent niches in a local environment ( Niklas and Kutschera, 2009 ). In diff erent evolutionary groups of living land plants, diff erent parts of the life cycle are emphasized. Th is diversity can also be seen in the early fossil record of land plants. Some plants (e.g. bryophytes and some early Cooksonia species— see Section 3.3 ) acquired an amplifi ed gametophyte generation (resulting in a sporophyte generation nutritionally de- pendent on the gametophyte phase; Boyce, 2008 ) ( Figure 3.8 c), whereas others developed an amplifi ed sporophyte generation (resulting in a nutritionally independent sporophyte, e.g. vascular plants) ( Figure 3.8 d). Others (e.g. Aglaophyton major— see Section 3.3 ) had a relatively even split between gametophyte and sporophyte with neither emphasized ( Taylor et al ., 2005 ) ( Figure 3.8 b). Elaboration of the gametophyte stage would, if anything, have increased the need for water, since water is essential for the survival of the gametophyte, the transfer of the sperm to the egg, and the initial growth of the sporophyte embryo ( Nik- las, 1997 ). It can be suggested, therefore, that in continually moist environments with little desiccation stress the gametophyte generation would have been emphasized or selected for. In contrast, elaboration of the sporophyte stage would have decreased the necessity for water, since neither the production nor dissemination of spores is reliant upon water. Th us, desiccating environments would have imposed intense selective pressure in favour of such amplifi cation of the sporophyte generation. Th is diff erentiation of amplifi cation in the gametophyte or sporophyte generation has persisted to the present day. In extant vascular plants (tracheophytes) the vegetative sporo- phyte is the ‘visible’ plant body, whereas in non-vascular groups (e.g. bryophytes) the veg- etative gametophyte is the ‘visible’ plant body ( Figure 3.8 c,d). Th is diff erentiation may well explain why, throughout the geological record, bryophytes have remained relatively small (less than 1 m in height) and restricted to damp, moist regions, whereas tracheophytes have evolved not only to some of the largest plants on this planet, but also to fi ll almost every ecological niche available. Protection against desiccation It has been suggested that the appearance and gradual increased diversity of trilete spores in the fossil record from ∼430 Ma, in the Late Silurian onwards, is not only indicative of elaboration of the sporophyte phase but also the development of spores that were increasingly resistant to decay ( Wellman et al ., 2003 ; Wellman, 2004 ). In particular, it 03-WillisandMcElwain-Chap03.indd 6403-WillisandMcElwain-Chap03.indd 64 11/28/13 1:05 PM11/28/13 1:05 PM 653.2 FOSSIL EVIDENCE FOR PLANT TERRESTRIALIZATION is suggested that spores with walls containing sporopollenin were developing ( Graham, 1993 ; Graham and Gray, 2001 ; Raven and Edwards, 2004 ). Sporopollenin is found in the walls of most extant pollen and spores, in both vascular and non-vascular plants and also in some algae. It is a complex polymer that provides desiccation resistance, robustness, and protection from ultraviolet radiation ( Kenrick and Crane, 1997a , b ; Van Bergen et al ., 2004 ). Th e evolution of desiccation-resistant spores was extremely important to the ter- restrialization process. It would have enabled long-distance spore dispersal by wind and therefore a means of establishment of isolated communities far into the continental inte- riors ( Taylor and Taylor, 1993 ). It is proposed that desiccation-resistant spores may have been produced initially by aquatic or semi-aquatic green algae in response to periodic drying ( Th omas and Spicer, 1987 ). However, it was not only spores that needed protection from desiccation; both the vege- tative sporophyte and vegetative gametophytes would also have been extremely susceptible without special adaptations. Th is is in direct contrast to the situation that would have oc- curred in aquatic environments. Here, any barrier preventing the free fl ow of water, solutes, soluble CO 2 , and waste products between the plant and the nutrient solution in which it was bathed would have been disadvantageous ( Raven, 1993 ; Taylor and Taylor, 1993 ). Th e adaptation to prevent desiccation of all aerial parts of the plant body was the evolution of cuticle. Cuticle is a layer of wax and insoluble lipid polymers that covers and impregnates the walls of the epidermal cells to reduce water loss, and is present on the aerial parts of every living land plant. Fossil evidence for sheets of resistant cuticle lacking stomata appear in the geological record as early as the Late Ordovician (∼450 Ma) and more familiar cuti- cle types with stomata are evident in sediments from the late Silurian (∼420 Ma) ( Edwards and Fanning, 1985 ; Gray and Shear, 1992 ; Gensel, 2008 ; Kenrick et al ., 2012 ). Although this early cuticle is ‘disarticulated’, i.e. not attached to whole plant bodies, its presence in the fossil record suggests land colonization as early as 450 Ma. In comparison to other lines of evidence for terrestrialization (e.g. spores with envelopes such as monads and dyads), the evidence for cuticles appears comparatively late in the fossil record ( Gray, 1993 ; Kenrick and Crane, 1997a , b ). It has been suggested that this may be due to the fact that the fatty acids of which the cuticle is composed saponify in water ( Th omas and Spicer, 1987 ). However, another more likely interpretation is that the various features providing protection against desiccation were acquired sequentially. Although formation of the cuticle would have protected against desiccation, microbial attack, abrasion, and mechanical injury, it would also have prevented the fl ow of gases (in particular CO 2 and O 2 ) into and out of the plant. Th e earliest evolutionary solution to this dilemma appears to have been the development of an imperforate but thin cuticle, which would have allowed the movement of gases by diff usion ( Th omas and Spicer, 1987 ). Th is facilitation of gas diff usion is one that occurs in some extant mosses, liverworts, and hornworts. However, a more refi ned feature for regulation of gases and water came with the evolution of stomata, from approximately 420 million years ago in the latest Silurian/ earliest Devonian. Th e earliest land plants evolved into an atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide and conse- quently few stomata per unit surface area would be required to maintain suffi cient inter- nal CO 2 concentrations to power photosynthesis. An advantage of low stomatal densities in the earliest land plants was that water loss via transpiration through the stomatal pore 03-WillisandMcElwain-Chap03.indd 6503-WillisandMcElwain-Chap03.indd 65 11/28/13 1:05 PM11/28/13 1:05 PM 66 3 THE COLONIZATION OF LAND was minimized. It is likely that very elevated CO 2 concentrations facilitated the terrestri- alization process by minimizing desiccation stress of the earliest land plants ( McElwain and Chaloner, 1995 ; Chaloner and McElwain, 1997 ; McElwain, 1998 ). In early Devonian plants, for example, the density of stomata per mm 2 area was extremely low (<5 mm –2 ) in relation to fossil plants from other periods in the geological record (>50 and up to 1000 mm –2 ). When these fossil stomatal densities are compared to estimated changes in global atmospheric CO 2 through time ( Berner, 1997 ) there appears to be a close correspondence. High stomatal densi- ties occur at times of low atmospheric CO 2 and vice versa ( Figure 3.9 ). Th is evidence there- fore suggests that even the earliest land plants were in tune physiologically with atmospheric composition ( McElwain, 1998 ). Development of specialized cells for water and nutrient uptake When plants are located in an aquatic environment there is little requirement for a spe- cialized system to distribute water, solutes, and photosynthetic products since all cells are a short distance from the water and nutrients source ( Th omas and Spicer, 1987 ). With terrestrialization, early land plants would have required specialized conducting tissue to transport food and water about the plant, especially if vertical growth was involved. Cal- culations have indicated, for example, that even a modest height of 2 cm requires spe- cialized conducting tissues ( Niklas, 1997 ). Th e solution was the evolution of hollow cells within the plant body with cell walls strong enough to withstand the compressive pressure imposed by the pull of water through the plant ( Sperry, 2003 ). Th e advantages of this simple anatomical modifi cation were many, including (i) increased capacity to conduct Figure 3.9 Changes in atmospheric CO 2 concentration estimated from a long-term carbon cycle model (GEOCARB II, Berner 1993 ).

From approximately 475 million years ago (lower Ordovician) various simple tubes, indicative of these hollow cells, appear in the fossil record ( Figure 3.10 ) with evidence of increasing complexity around 380 Ma. These structures are taken to be indicative of the evolution of an early conducting system ( Gray and Shear, 1992 ; Edwards, 2000 ; Edwards, 2003 ). The tubes can be divided into two groups according to size and structure. There are those that are narrow (approximately 8–20 μm in diameter and 50 μm long) and fre- quently smooth, and those that are longer (up to 200 μm long) with an annular-helical thickening on the inner surface ( Taylor and Taylor, 1993 ; Edwards, 2000 ; Wellman and Gray, 2000 ) ( Figure 3.10 ). The former have been likened to those found in many extant non-vascular plants (bryophytes) (e.g. Kodner and Graham ( 2001 ) found that high- temperature, acidic-hydrolyzed remains of Polytrichium bear a close morphological similarity to Silurian tubular microfossils) and the latter to those of vegetative sporo- phytes (e.g. from some of the earliest known land plants, rhyniophytoids) ( Edwards, 2000 ; Edwards, 2003 ).

Th e earliest and simplest tubes in the fossil record ( Figure 3.10 ) are therefore attributed to non-vascular plants, belonging to extinct fossil plant genera such as Aglaophyton and Horneophyton ( see Section 3.3 ). Th e greater the demand for water (and the higher the plant may grow), the more important the thickening, since there is a ‘critical size’ (sensu Niklas, 1997 ) at which the threshold of vertical height will impose selection favouring conducting tissue. It has therefore been suggested that many of the more structurally complex tubes with thickenings likely contained lignin and should therefore be classifi ed as tracheids of the earliest vascular plants. Detailed chemical analysis has confi rmed the presence of lignin in Early Devonian (∼415 Ma) plants such as Psilophyton ( Boyce et al ., 2003 ; Steemans et al ., 2009 ; Weng and Chapple, 2010 ). It is interesting to note here that the ability to synthesize lignin is apparently highly dependent on the levels of atmos- pheric O 2 , with estimates suggesting that lignin formation could not have proceeded until the Cambrian (∼540 million years ago) ( Chapman, 1985 ). It is also likely that the original function of lignin was as a chemical defence compound but it was later co-opted to provide mechanical strength in vascular tissues. Th ree distinct tracheid types are now recognized in the early fossil record ( Kenrick and Crane, 1991 , 1997a , b ) and according to their cell wall construction are defi ned as follows ( Figure 3.11 ): i) G-type cell wall with annular-reticulate thickenings; ii) S-type cell wall with helical thickenings that appear to combine certain features of tracheids (e.g. lignifi ed thickenings) and moss hydroids; iii) P-type cell wall with scalariform pittings (pits in the secondary cell wall elongated transversely and parallel to each other). Evidence from the fossil record therefore suggests that by the earliest Devonian (∼420 Ma) a system had evolved to transport water and nutrients around the plant body and that in- creasing complexity in cell wall thickenings would have enabled greater longitudinal exten- sion of individual cells, thereby allowing them to become longer and the plants to grow taller and transport water from cell to cell more effi ciently ( Sperry, 2003 ). Mechanical support With the loss of support provided by water, another adaptation necessary in the process of terrestrialization was a means of staying upright. Although the mechanical strength of lignin would have provided some support ( Taylor and Taylor, 1993 ), calculations on stem diameter suggest that structural organization was also important ( Niklas, 1986 , 1994 , 1997 ; Rowe and Speck, 2005 ). Calculations on the biomechanics of early terrestrial vegetation have indicated that al- though there is no single ‘optimal’ plant morphology, the simplest means of attaining maxi- mum surface area to volume ratios for light interception, gas exchange, and indeterminate 03-WillisandMcElwain-Chap03.indd 6803-WillisandMcElwain-Chap03.indd 68 11/28/13 1:05 PM11/28/13 1:05 PM 693.2 FOSSIL EVIDENCE FOR PLANT TERRESTRIALIZATION growth is the fl at dorsiventral shape. Th is is the condition in which the plant does not have any vertical growth but instead grows horizontally across the rock or substrate on which it is situated ( Niklas, 1986 ). Many extant liverworts and some green algae (e.g. Coleochaete ) con- form to this shape, and in the fossil record there is evidence to suggest that Parka decipiens possessed this biomechanical design. For attainment of height, the next best biomechanical solution is to have a stem that allows a plant to continue to grow longitudinally with only a minor reduction in volume to surface area ratio, resulting in a large, wide, fl at top and a small stem. It has been calcu- lated that the best shape for such a stem is a cylinder ( Niklas, 1986 , 1998 ). Th e maximum height of such a cylindrical stem before buckling will depend upon its ‘fl exural rigidity’, which combines the material properties of the structure with the cross-sectional geom- etry. Calculations suggest that if fl exural rigidity is to be maintained/maximized, stems lacking secondary growth (i.e. wood) must be solid and/or thick walled and as broad as possible. For example, calculations suggest that a hollow, thickened-walled cylinder will grow approximately 26 per cent taller than a solid cylinder ( Niklas, 1986 ). Th e fossil re- cord appears to confi rm these calculations in that the early stems appear to become wider and longer and to have a greater internal diameter with decreasing age of deposit ( Niklas, 1997 ). However, a note of caution must be added here since thickening of the stem wall in the early land plants would have created potentially confl icting requirements between mechanical strength and photosynthesis. In the absence of leaves, the optimal position for photosynthetic tissue would be just below the surface of the stem ( Niklas, 1997 ), but this would also be the optimal position for the bulk of the strengthening material (cell wall) in the stem. In early plants, however, this problem was overcome by the fact that the cells that provided support functioned hydrostatically (that is when infl ated with water these Figure 3.11 Cell wall structure of early tubes and tracheids in the fossil record. Three types of tracheid have been distinguished according to their cell wall construction, as follows: (a) G-type cell wall with annular- reticulate thickenings; (b) S-type cell wall with helical thickenings that appear to combine certain features of tracheids (e.g. ligniﬁ ed thickenings) and moss hydroids; (c) P-type cell walls with scalariform pitting.

Th e optimum location for hydrostatic cells, since they are water conducting, is in the middle of the stem. Evidence from the fossil record indicates, therefore, that the earliest land plants had short, wide stems with a photosynthetic ‘rind’ just beneath the surface and hydrostatic tissue (parenchyma) in the centre ( Niklas, 1997 ). Calculations also suggest, however, that to gain greater height than a few centimetres, it would have been necessary to have some specialized mechanical tissue. Th e next best mechanical so- lution, therefore, is to have mechanical tissue (outer cortical tissue, collenchyma) between the photosynthetic rind and the infl atable hydrostatic core ( Niklas, 1997 ) ( Figure 3.12 ). A number of early vascular plants demonstrate this morphology. However, it is calculated that eventu- ally the thickening required to attain greater heights would have presented a physical barrier to photosynthesis and the solution would have been to compartmentalize the functions of the plant body into those for photosynthesis and those for mechanical support ( see Chapter 4 ). Anchoring mechanisms Standing upright was not the only structural problem associated with the terrestrialization process. Early land plants also needed to acquire a system to anchor them to the ground and enable them to obtain the mineral elements necessary for nutrition and water from soils. Th e earliest unequivocal fossil evidence for root-like structures comes from plant and root traces preserved in palaeosols dating from around 408 million years ago (early Devo- nian). Th ese traces indicate a system of fi laments between 0.5 and 2 cm in diameter and up to 90 cm in length, thus providing evidence that some early land plants were capable of rooting Figure 3.12 Relationship between stem diameter and stelar construction.

However, it would also appear that early rooting structures were relatively undiff erentiated from the aerial parts of the plant ( Giff ord and Foster, 1989 ) and lacked a root cap or endodermis, two features characteristic of rooting sys- tems in vascular plants ( Raven and Edwards, 2001 ; Pires and Dolan, 2012 ). It is envisaged, therefore, that as the lower part of the plant became covered with mud, it became specialized into a true rooting system ( Friedman et al ., 2004 ). In summary, evidence from early fossil spores, tubes and cuticles suggests that the period between the late Ordovician and early Silurian was a time of major innovation. Th e ter- restrialization process involved modifi cation of the green plant life cycle, evolution of a re- productive system that was not primarily dependent on water, and various mechanisms to enable plant growth and survival outside of an aquatic medium. All of these modifi cations fi rst appeared between approximately 475 and 430 million years ago ( Figure 3.13 ), followed closely by the fi rst evidence of entire land plant organs, such as stems and reproductive structures, from the early Devonian (∼420 Ma) which will be discussed in the next section.

Terminal sporangia 6.5 cm Simple dichotomously branched plant body 3.3 Examples of earliest land plants in the fossil record Evidence for entire vascular land plant organs, such as stems and reproductive structures, starts to appear in the fossil record in the late Silurian/early Devonian (∼430–420 Ma). Th ese macrofossils (rather than the microfossils of single tubes, tracheids, spores, etc.) have been identifi ed from enough fossil localities to suggest that a vegetation of small-stature vascu- lar plants had become established on many continents ( Edwards and Selden, 1992 ; Algeo, 1998 ). Taxonomic descriptions of early land plants in the literature (e.g. Edwards, 1982 ; Edwards and Fanning, 1985 ; Gensel and Andrews, 1987 ; White, 1990 ; Kenrick and Crane, 1997a , b ; Gensel and Edwards, 2001 ; Taylor et al ., 2009 ) also suggest that by the early Devo- nian, there was some diversity in the terrestrial plant world. It is beyond the scope of this book to describe all these types in detail, but six examples of the most common early land plants found in the fossil record are discussed. Cooksonia Early plants that are classifi ed as Cooksonia ( Figure 3.14 ) occur in a large number of fossil localities in North America and Europe. Th e earliest examples of Cooksonia have been found in deposits from Ireland dating to early Silurian age (Wenlockian, ∼425 Ma) ( Edwards and 03-WillisandMcElwain-Chap03.indd 7203-WillisandMcElwain-Chap03.indd 72 11/28/13 1:05 PM11/28/13 1:05 PM 733.3 EXAMPLES OF EARLIEST LAND PLANTS IN THE FOSSIL RECORD Feehan, 1980 ; Edwards et al ., 1983 ). Th ese plants were leafl ess, with a simple dichotomously branched plant body with sporangia (the spore-bearing structures) at the end of each branch tip (known as terminal sporangia). It would appear that these plants grew to no more than 6.5 cm tall and probably formed swards in swampy places. For example, some fossil samples have been found demonstrating a cluster of fi ve individual sporophytes joined together at the base ( Gerrienne et al ., 2006 ). Stomates and some details of internal anatomy have been de- scribed in some of the earliest Cooksonia (e.g. Cooksonia pertonii ; Kenrick and Crane, 1997a ). In many examples, however, no internal anatomy or cuticular features have been observed, and the suggestion has been made that perhaps they were non-photosynthetic structures and derived their nutrition from a gametophyte that has not been preserved (Boyce, 2008). Aglaophyton major Aglaophyton major ( Figure 3.15 ) is found in the Rhynie Chert, Scotland, and is dated to approximately 407 Ma (early Devonian, Emsian) ( Rice et al ., 1994 ). It was morphologi- cally more complex than Cooksonia , and consisted of branched aerial stems that grew up to 20 cm tall, rising from a horizontal rhizome ( Edwards, 1986 ; Bell, 1992 ; Kenrick and Crane, 1997a , b ; Taylor et al ., 2009 ). As in Cooksonia , the sporangia were located at the tips of the stems, and there was a well-defi ned cuticle with stomata in the aerial parts of the plant. A rooting system was provided by prostrate rhizomes bearing small rhizoids that branched off from the main body of the plant ( Figure 3.15 ). Figure 3.15 Reconstruction of fossil Aglaophyton major .

Th ese fossils record a plant growing to approximately 18 cm tall with simple dichotomizing stems arising from a rhizome bearing thread-like rhizoids ( Figure 3.16 ). Th e stems were 2–3 cm in diameter ( Taylor et al ., 2009 ) and were vascularized with helical S-type elements ( Kenrick and Crane, 1991 ; Gerrienne et al ., 2006 ). Sporangia were borne singly at the tip of the main stem and produced spores in tetrahedral tetrads. Each spore was approximately 40 μm in diameter, covered in closely spaced spines.

Th ese sporangia were borne on short stalks and usually in two rows orien- tated to one side of the axis ( Figure 3.17 ). Th e spores were approximately 55–85 μm in diam- eter, circular to sub-triangular, smooth, and bore a distinctive trilete marking ( Kenrick and Crane, 1997a ). Th e plant grew to an overall height of approximately 30 cm and consisted of branches that grew up and out from a rhizome at an acute angle (sometimes described as H-type branching, Figure 3.17 ). Th ese branches were between 1 and 4 mm in diameter and covered with numerous tapered spines ( Taylor et al ., 2009 ). Inside the stem was a solid core of tracheids, interpreted possibly as G-type cells ( see above; Kenrick and Crane, 1991 , 1997a , b ).

Redrawn from White ( 1990 ) . Baragwanathia longifolia Baragwanathia longifolia ( Figure 3.18 ) has been identifi ed from a number of Australian sites that were part of the Gondwanaland supercontinent. Th ey were composed of a robust stem that was approximately 1–2 cm in diameter and thickly covered with long, slender leaves ( Gensel and Andrews, 1987 ). Fossil evidence shows that the stems were extremely long, extending out from a rhizomatous base up to 1 m. Th e stems contained tracheids with annular or helical thickenings, some with a G-type appearance, and were covered with closely arranged leaves up to 4 cm in length ( Figure 3.18 ) ( Kenrick and Crane, 1997a ). Sporangia were arranged along the stem, although it is unclear whether these were actually attached to the stem itself or to the base of the leaves. Th e spores were smooth, had trilete markings, and were up to 50 μm in diameter. Th e age of Baragwanathia longifolia has been the subject of debate. Originally it was de- scribed as late Silurian (∼420 Ma) and then lower Devonian (∼410 Ma) ( Lang and Cookson, 1935 ). Its co-occurrence with well-constrained, late Silurian invertebrate fossils appeared to support the suggestion of a considerably earlier fi rst appearance (∼420 Ma), at least on Gond- wanaland ( Garratt et al ., 1984 ; Tims and Chambers, 1984 ). If this earlier age is accepted, it has important evolutionary implications since Baragwanathia longifolia was morphologi- cally more complex, large, and had leaves ( Garratt et al ., 1984 ), yet was present on the land before all but Cooksonia ( Gensel and Andrews, 1987 ). More recent research, however, has once again questioned the age of these deposits (for discussion, see Hueber, 1992 ; Kenrick and Crane, 1997a ) and it is suggested that they are more likely to be of early Devonian age. Psilophyton dawsonii Psilophyton dawsonii ( Figure 3.19 ) has been identifi ed at a number of fossil localities dat- ing back to approximately 395 million years ago ( Banks et al ., 1975 ; Edwards and Fanning, 1985 ). It is known to have grown to a height of approximately 60 cm, with greatly branched fertile and vegetative lateral branches growing out from a central stem. Th e fertile branches 03-WillisandMcElwain-Chap03.indd 7603-WillisandMcElwain-Chap03.indd 76 11/28/13 1:05 PM11/28/13 1:05 PM 773.4 EVOLUTIONARY TRENDS: GREEN ALGAE TO LAND PLANTS typically dichotomized up to six times before terminating in clusters of approximately 32 sporangia ( Figure 3.19 ) ( Bell, 1992 ; Taylor et al ., 2009 ). Th is plant had a sophisticated vascular system made up of radially aligned tracheids (scalariform pitted P-type cells, see Figure 3.11c) ( Kenrick and Crane, 1997a , b ). Since the fi rst discovery of early land plants in the fossil record, many attempts have been made to establish a phylogenetic relationship between these earliest plant fossils and extant spe- cies. However, a problem encountered in many of these studies has been in determining whether early land plants such as Aglaophyton (described above) are vascular (i.e. tracheophytes: plants that contain lignifi ed tracheids) or non-vascular (i.e. bryophytes: plants that do not contain lignifi ed tracheids—mosses, liverworts, and hornworts) ( Edwards, 1986 ). Morphological phy- logenetic studies (e.g. Kenrick and Crane, 1997a , b ) have therefore included a basal clade, poly- sporangiophytes ( see Section 3.5 ), which incorporates both vascular and non-vascular plants. 3.4 Evolutionary trends: green algae to land plants Geological evidence suggests that by 450 million years ago plant evolution had progressed from simple multicellular eukaryotic organisms that were reliant upon an aquatic medium for survival (e.g. green algae) to more complex multicellular land plants (embryophytes) Figure 3.19 Photograph of Psilophyton forbesi alongside sketch of Psilophyton dawsonii to indicate main features.

However, what is not so clear from the geological record alone is the evolutionary pathway that led from the green algae to the fi rst land plants. Over the past 20 years, a large body of research using ultrastructural, biochemi- cal, and molecular characteristics of extant and fossil plants has made signifi cant steps in determining the evolutionary pathway from green algae to land plants (see reviews in Lewis and McCourt, 2004 ; Judd et al ., 2008 ; Niklas and Kutschera, 2009 ; Popper et al ., 2011 ). Th e prevailing conclusion of these studies to date is that land plants (vascular and non-vascular) evolved from the green algae and, in particular, the Charales group ( Figure 3.20 ). A summary of the evidence that has led to this conclusion is presented below. Evidence for evolutionary links between green algae and land plants (i) Green algae, similar to land plants, are photosynthetic eukaryotes bearing plastids containing chlorophyll a and b , the pigments beta-carotene and xanthophylls, a unique stel- late structure linking nine pairs of microtubules in the fl agellar base, starch inside the plastid, Figure 3.20 Evolutionary relationships among green plants (Viridophytes or Viridoplantae) showing that Charales are the closest living relatives of land plants based on molecular data.

(ii) Within the green algae there is a basal split into two clades, a chlorophyte clade and a streptophyte clade ( Karol et al ., 2001 ; Figure 3.20 ; Table 3.1 ). Th e key distinguishing feature be- tween the chlorophyte and streptophyte clade is the presence of the enzyme glycolate oxidase in the latter. Th e enzyme glycolate oxidase is also characteristic of all land plants ( Frederick et al ., 1973 ; Bell, 1992 ). Th e presence of glycolate oxidase would have been particularly advantageous to early land-dwelling plants ( Graham, 1993 ) because it is a key component of the photorespi- ration pathway, an important biochemical tool kit for screening land plants and their algal an- cestors from the damaging eff ects of ultraviolet (UV) and visible radiation. One important way in which photorespiration prevents damage by light to the photosynthetic machinery (oft en termed photoinhibition) is by providing a source of CO 2 to drive photosynthesis. Th is eff ec- tively uses up the light energy to assimilate sugars rather than allowing it to be diverted into the Table 3.1 Order-level classiﬁ cation within ‘green algae’ from Lewis and McCourt ( 2004 ) .

As green plants began to occupy shallower and shallower aquatic habitats leading eventually to the conquest of the land, photorespiration together with the pigments beta-carotene and xanthophylls would have provided a means of screening against the UV and visible radiation. (iii) Within the streptophyte clade there are six branches of green algae. Each successive branch can be distinguished according to increasing levels of ultrastructural and molecular complexity that lead to the complexity apparent in land plants ( Figure 3.20 ). Important in- novations along the route to land plants (embryophytes) include increasing morphological complexity from single celled forms like Mesostigma and Chlorokybus at the base of strep- tophytes to complex branching forms like Chara (Charales) ( Figure 3.20 ). Fossil evidence The fossil record of green algae (streptophytes) is poor. This is most likely in large part because the streptophytes, unlike embryophytes, lacked highly desiccation- resistant compounds such as cutan, sporopollenin, and (with the exception of Chole- ochaetales), lignin, which would have decreased the likelihood of their preservation in the fossil record. The oldest body fossil representatives of Charophytes, including Cha- rales and Coleochaetales, dates back to the late Silurian/early Devonian (reviewed in Martín- Closas, 2003 ). Examples of these early fossils include terrestrial thalloid forms (∼415–395 Ma) that bear a remarkable morphological similarity to the thallus of mod- ern Coleochaete (Coleochaetales, Figure 3.21 ). This fossil plant, called Parka decipiens ( Figure 3.21 ), was between 0.5 and 7.0 cm in diameter and composed of cells arranged in a pseudoparenchymous organization, spread horizontally across the surface of the substrate. Disc-shaped structures found on the surface of the thallus are thought to be fossil remains of the sporangia ( Taylor and Taylor, 1993 ) and many of them contain small, compressed bodies that are thought to be spores. Ancestors of modern Charales include Palaeonitellia from the famous Devonian-aged Rhynie chert locality ( Kidston and Lang, 1921 ) and Octochara and Hexachara from similar aged localities in South Africa ( Gess and Hiller, 1995 ) ( Figure 3.22 ). Martín-Closas ( 2003 ) has argued based on the complexities of Charophyte fossil morphologies observed in the Carbonifer- ous (359 to 299 Ma) that Charales were likely undergoing an evolutionary radiation alongside that of embryophytes in the Silurian and Devonian but little evidence was preserved in the fossil record. Evidence for evolutionary links between the green algae group Charales and land plants i) Charales and land plants demonstrate strong similarities in the gene sequences of mitochondrial, chloroplast, and nuclear DNA ( Karol et al ., 2001 ). Whole genome analysis of Chara vulgaris , for example, place it as the sister to land plants ( Turmel et al ., 2003 ). Molecular phylogenetics therefore suggest that Charales share a more recent common ancestor with land plants than they do with the other major green algal groups ( Figure 3.20 ). 03-WillisandMcElwain-Chap03.indd 8003-WillisandMcElwain-Chap03.indd 80 11/28/13 1:05 PM11/28/13 1:05 PM 813.4 EVOLUTIONARY TRENDS: GREEN ALGAE TO LAND PLANTS Figure 3.21 An early fossil example of Coleochaetales ( Parka decipens ) from Devonian localities in Scotland and the United States.

Charales are also the only green algae to encase the egg within protective tissue, a feature similar to embryophytes. iii) Charales and their sister group Choleochaetales also share a number of important chemical components of the cell wall with land plants that are not found in any other group of streptophyte algae ( Table 3.2 ). Th ese include fl avonoids to protect against UV-B radiation and a biochemical precursor of the cuticle to protect against water loss in an increasingly terrestrial environment ( Popper et al ., 2011 ). All of the above studies suggest that the ancestors of all land plants early on in their evo- lutionary history had evolved biochemical pathways (e.g. photorespiration), novel com- pounds (e.g. cell wall lignin ( Popper et al ., 2011 ), fl avonoids, sporopollenin), and life cycle modifi cations that would enable survival in shallow freshwater aquatic habitats perhaps prone to wetting and drying cycles. All of these innovations were precursor adaptations to life in fully terrestrial environments by land plants. Greening of the land: an alternative view Surprisingly, the fi rst land dwelling plants may not have been embryophytes but rather the green algae themselves. Th ere is evidence for many groups of modern algae having adaptations to land-dwelling ( Lewis and McCourt, 2004 ). Terrestrial algae are present, for example, in all three extant chlorophyte clades and four streptophyte clades ( Figure 3.20 ). Th ey occupy varied and oft en extreme terrestrial habitats for much of their life cycle, in- cluding deserts, bare soil, snow, ice, and rock but all require liquid water for reproduc- tion. Many of these terrestrial algae belong to evolutionary groups that have not evolved resistant biomacromolecules such as sporopollenin. Th e likelihood of any early terrestrial green algae being preserved in the fossil record would therefore be dismally low. Molecu- lar clock estimates place the time or origin of chlorophyte green algae, however, as early Table 3.2 Similarities in cell wall biochemistry among embryophytes and streptophyte green algae that support close evolutionary relationship between Charales and embryophytes.

Th eoretically, therefore, there is an intriguing possibility that the conquest of the land (by algae and fungi) preceded the evolution of land plants (embryophytes) by hundreds of millions of years. Perhaps Rodinia, the fi rst supercontinent on Earth over 1000 Ma, was green with acid resistant, extreme temperature-tolerant green terrestrial algae? Th ere is as yet no fossil evidence that the con- quest of the land took place prior to ∼470 Ma by the earliest embryophytes (reviewed in Wellman, 2010 ; Kenrick et al ., 2012 ). However, a recent compilation of carbon and oxygen isotopic data extracted from Precambrian aged sediments hint that terrestrial environ- ments were being modifi ed by the process of photosynthesis as early as 800 Ma ( Knauth and Kennedy, 2009 ). Further study is needed to examine whether the modifi cation of early Precambrian land surfaces was caused by a crust made up exclusively of single-celled cy- anobacteria or whether multicellular chlorophyte green algae and fungi were also involved. 3.5 Evolutionary trends in land plants: non-vascular to vascular Th e evolution of vascular plants from a non-vascular ancestor was a hugely signifi cant step in plant evolution. Th e evolutionary innovation of a lignifi ed vascular transport system allowed plants to increase in size and increasingly occupy drier habitats. Th e innovation of branching within the sporophyte body allowed plants to explore more and more complex architectures and compete for light, thus increasing the complexity and number of canopy layers within terrestrial ecosystems. In addition, for the fi rst time in plant evolutionary his- tory the adult stage of the life cycle was the sporophyte in vascular plants rather than the gametophyte in non-vascular plants. Carrying two sets of chromosomes rather than one would have enabled deleterious recessive mutations to be masked. Decreasing the size and life span of the water-requiring gametophyte stage also increased the potential to expand geographically away from permanent water sources such as lakes and streams. A number of interesting questions regarding the evolutionary relationship between the vascular plants, the non-vascular plants, and green algae emerge. For example, does a closer evolutionary relationship exist between one branch of the non-vascular plants (for example the hornworts) and vascular plants than others (such as the liverworts or mosses)? Similar to tracing the possible evolutionary links between green algae and land plants, a number of diff erent lines of evidence have been addressed, including fossil and molecular evidence as follows. Plant fossil evidence Th ere is increasing geological evidence to support the notion that the earliest land plants were non-vascular, that is they were related to living bryophytes (mosses, liverworts, and hornworts), and that vascular plants (tracheophytes) evolved later. Evidence that bryo- phytes dominated terrestrial ecosystems dates from ∼470 Ma in the middle Ordovician to ∼440 Ma in the early Silurian. Th e fossil evidence comes mainly from microfossils includ- ing spores, isolated sheets of cells thought to be early protocuticle (called nematophyte 03-WillisandMcElwain-Chap03.indd 8303-WillisandMcElwain-Chap03.indd 83 11/28/13 1:05 PM11/28/13 1:05 PM 84 3 THE COLONIZATION OF LAND cuticle), and isolated tubes thought to derive from early non-vascular water transport sys- tems ( Figure 3.11 ; Kenrick 2012 ). An example of some of the earliest spores, called crypto- spores, comes from Argentina and is dated to ∼470 Ma ( Rubinstein and Vaccari, 2004 ), with slightly later examples from Czech Republic and Saudi Arabia ( Strother et al ., 1996 ). Th ere is also fossil evidence for walled sporophytes containing in situ spores from Oman around 450 Ma ( Wellman et al ., 2003 ). Th ese tiny fossils represent the earliest convincing evidence for embryophytes. Detailed chemical and ultrastructural studies on these earli- est fossils adds further support to the suggestion that they were produced by the earli- est bryophytes ( Taylor et al ., 1995 ; Wellman, 2003 ; Steemans et al ., 2010 ) with evidence for smooth fossil tubes and cuticle-like sheets with no stomata (nematophytes) ( Graham et al ., 2004 ) to indicate close structural similarity to the rhizoids and sub-epidermis of modern day liverworts ( Figure 3.13 ). By approximately 440 Ma (early Silurian) there is a remarkable change in the composition of the microfossil record ( Steemans et al ., 2009 ; Kenrick et al ., 2012 ). Th e abundance of cryptospores in packages of two (dyads) and four (tetrads) indicative of non-vascular plants decreases sharply and individually dispersed spores (hilate and trilete) indicative of vascular plants increase in abundance ( Figure 3.7 ). Th is major turnover event in the microfossil record has been used to pinpoint the timing of origin of vascular plant lineages and to indicate a transition from non-vascular to vascular plant-dominated ecosystems ( Steemans et al ., 2009 ; Kenrick et al ., 2012 ). Th e timing of this transition is supported by the occurrence of fossil banded tubes associated with vascular plants in similarly aged sediments ( Figure 3.13 ). Phylogenetic evidence for transition from non-vascular to vascular land plants Fossil evidence for the earliest land plants (embryophytes) as discussed above is ∼470–450 Ma. Features that make this clade distinctive from the green algae include the presence of multicellular sporophytes, embryo, gametes, spores, and cuticle. Th is clade therefore includes non-vascular plants (i.e. liverworts, mosses, and hornworts) and vas- cular plants (i.e. polysporangiophytes: Horneophyton , Aglaophyton , and vascular plants). Th e evolutionary pathway from non-vascular to vascular has been the topic of extensive study and debate ( Mishler and Churchill, 1984 , 1985 ; Kenrick and Crane, 1997a , b ; Qiu et al ., 2006 ; Ligrone et al ., 2012 ) and the development of both morphological and molecular-based phylogenies. Th e overall consensus from these phylogenetic studies on living plants indicates that the closest relatives to the vascular plants are the hornworts with an early basal split between the liverworts and the other groups, followed by the mosses. According to the most recent phylogenetic interpretations, there are three major evolution- ary steps between the liverworts and vascular plants. 1. Liverworts lack stomata . Th is therefore distinguishes liverworts from the other groups (mosses, hornworts, and polysporangiophytes) ( Ligrone et al ., 2012 ). Th e oldest body fossil evidence for cuticle with stomata is dated to ∼425 Ma ( Edwards et al ., 1983 ). 2. Mosses do not possess a persistently green sporophyte . Hornworts and polysporangiophytes (earliest vascular land plants) have an intercalary meristem at the base of the sporophyte capable of continuously producing new cells (indeterminate 03-WillisandMcElwain-Chap03.indd 8403-WillisandMcElwain-Chap03.indd 84 11/28/13 1:05 PM11/28/13 1:05 PM 853.5 EVOLUTIONARY TRENDS IN LAND PLANTS: NON-VASCULAR TO VASCULAR growth), which is green and photosynthetic. In contrast mosses and liverwort sporophytes have a predetermined growth plan and cannot continuously grow new cells capable of photosynthesis. Hornworts and polysporangiophytes are therefore distinguishable by this feature and this makes hornworts and vascular plants phylogenetically closer. 3. Hornworts do not possess a sporophyte that has independent branching . Th e innovation of this feature occurred >425 Ma. Th is, in addition to independence of the sporophyte from the gametophyte (independent alteration of generations), makes polysporangiophytes distinguishable from hornworts ( Figure 3.8 ). Phylogenetic analyses incorporating morphological data suggest that further division within the polysporangiophytes can then be ascribed as follows: (a) Th e polysporangiophytes divide into the tracheophytes and a separate clade consisting of the genus Aglaophyton and Horneophyton . Tracheophytes are distinguishable from the latter two by well-defi ned tracheids (i.e. water-conducting cells with helical, annular, or other more complex lignifi ed thickenings) ( Figure 3.23 ). (b) Tracheophytes are further divided into two clades, Rhyniopsida and Eutracheophytes (see Figure 3.23 ). Th e Rhyniopsida (which includes Rhynia , Figure 3.15 ) are defi ned by a distinctive type of adventitious branching, an abscission layer at the base of the sporangium, and the distinctive S-type tracheid. Th e Eutracheophytes contain all living vascular land plants and most extinct vascular plant fossil taxa. (c) Eutracheophytes can be divided into two major clades – the Lycophytina and the Euphyllophytina (see Figure 3.23). Th e Lycophytina are characterized by a number of features, including sporangia borne laterally along the stem or attached to it by a short stalk with marked thickening on the sporangial line of dehiscence (i.e. where the sporangium opens to release the spores). Fossil examples in this clade include both Zosterophyllum and Baragwanathia longifolia ( Figure 3.18 ). Th e Euphyllophytina clade includes all other land plants, including both living and extinct angiosperms (comprising over 99 per cent of extant vascular plant species), gymnosperms, ferns, and Equisetales. As a group, it is characterized by monopodial branching (i.e. a central stem from which other stems branch), a helical arrangement of branches, sporangia in pairs and grouped into terminal trusses (i.e. clustered at the ends of fertile branches), and multicellular appendages (spines). A fossil member of this clade is Psilophyton dawsonii ( Figure 3.19 ). Many of the early land plants have morphological features found in both non-vascular plants and vascular plants. In Aglaophyton major , for example (described in Section 3.3 ), there is evidence for nutritionally independent and branching sporophytes, which is typi- cal of extant vascular plants, but the absence of leaves, true roots (they have rhizoids), and well-defi ned thickening in the tracheids is typical of extant bryophytes ( Kenrick and Crane, 1991 , 1997a ; Edwards et al ., 1995 ). In a sense, therefore, such fossils provide an im- portant missing link to interpreting the evolution of vascular land plants. Th e phylogenetic relationship between these early vascular plant groups and extant vascular plants will be described in subsequent chapters. It is interesting to note here, however, that over 99 per 03-WillisandMcElwain-Chap03.indd 8503-WillisandMcElwain-Chap03.indd 85 11/28/13 1:05 PM11/28/13 1:05 PM 86 3 THE COLONIZATION OF LAND cent of extant vascular plants can be included in the Euphyllophytina clade, with most of the remaining 1 per cent in the Lycophytina clade. It would therefore appear that many of the characteristics determining our present-day fl ora were fi rst established at least 400 million years ago. 3.6 Biogeographical distribution of the earliest land plants in the late Silurian and early Devonian (~430–390 Ma) Th e earliest non-vascular ( Rubinstein et al ., 2010 ) and vascular plant fossils ( Steemans et al ., 2009 ) are all Gondwanan in origin, suggesting that both lineages may have their origin on the Gondwanan continent ( Wellman, 2010 ). Despite many new fossil fi nds, Figure 3.23 Currently accepted evolutionary relationship between bryophytes (non-vascular plants), polysporangiophytes, and tracheophytes (vascular plants) based on morphological and molecular sequence data.

Th is framework suggests that three epochs can be recognized in the spore record. Th e fi rst is termed the Eoembryophytic epoch (i.e. emphasizing the predominant role of the bryophytes in the early stages of terrestrialization). It is dated from mid-Ordovician to early Silurian (∼476–432 Ma) and represents the time in the fos- sil record when there is evidence for spore dyads and tetrads with a decay-resistant wall. Th e second epoch, the Eotracheophytic epoch, is dated to between early Silurian and early Devonian (∼432–402 Ma). It is marked by an increase in the presence of singly dispersed spores with trilete markings, and also an increase in elaboration of spores, along with other microfossil evidence for land plant fossils (e.g. tubes, tracheids, cuticle, stomata). Macrofossil evidence includes axes and reproductive structures indicating the fi rst land plants, all below 10 cm in height. Th irdly, the Eutracheophytic epoch, dated to between mid and late Devonian (∼389–356 Ma), represents a time when there was a widespread increase in spores and megafossils, a substantial increase in vascular plant diversity, and the appearance and diversifi cation of many important vascular plant groups (discussed in Chapter 4 ). It was originally assumed that the biogeographical distribution of plants in the Eotra- cheophytic epoch (432–402 Ma) was uniform and cosmopolitan (reviewed by Wnuk, 1996 ). Th ere is, however, increasing geological evidence to suggest that provinciality was well de- veloped from the fi rst appearance of vascular plants ( Raymond et al ., 1985 ; Raymond, 1987 ; Edwards and Berry, 1991 ; Wnuk, 1996 ; Gensel and Edwards, 2001 ). Detailed analysis of the composition and geography of early Devonian fl oras have been comprehensively reviewed in Edwards and Wellman ( 2001 ) . At the broadest level, fi ve biogeographic units have been recognized for this period (late Silurian–early Devonian) ( Raymond, 1985 , 1987 ; Ed- wards and Berry, 1991 ; Wnuk, 1996 ), a Siberian–North Laurussian region, a Kazakhstan region, a South Laurussian–China region, an Australian region ( Figure 3.24 ), and up to two Gondwanan regions (northern and southern), of which only the northern is shown in Figure 3.24 . Each had a distinctive fl ora, although many of the localities also shared common genera. Cluster analysis of the fossil assemblages covering this time period have also revealed that the same biogeographic units are determined if morphological traits (such as clustering of sporangia) are analysed instead of generic names ( Raymond, 1987 ). A tenuous link has therefore been made between these traits and climatic conditions. For example, in the case of clustered sporangia, it is suggested that this arrangement would have provided protection of the reproductive organs from dry or cold periods, by reducing the area of sporangia exposed to drying or freezing winds. Th is has led to the suggestion that even in the earliest stage of terrestrialization, environmental factors were a strong determinant in the global distribution of plants. 3.7 The inﬂ uence of land-dwelling plants on the Earth system It is now widely accepted that large scale change in plant evolution leading to the green- ing of terrestrial surfaces probably had very signifi cant impacts on the terrestrial land- scape between ∼470 Ma (Middle Ordovician) and the early Devonian (∼400 Ma). Detailed 03-WillisandMcElwain-Chap03.indd 8703-WillisandMcElwain-Chap03.indd 87 11/28/13 1:05 PM11/28/13 1:05 PM 88 3 THE COLONIZATION OF LAND investigation of the geometry of river systems and types of environment within the land- scape before and aft er the dawn of terrestrialization have revealed remarkable landscape- scale transformations. In the absence of embryophytes, sedimentological evidence indicates that river systems were broad with unstable banks, wind-blown sedimentary deposits (e.g. sand dunes) were widespread, and there was a notable absence of muddy river fl ood plains ( Gibling and Davies, 2012 ). Following the emergence of land plants there is evidence for development of channelled rivers with more stable river banks, muddy fl oodplain indicating weathering of uplands by plants, and the formation of soils ( Algeo, 1998 ) and peat deposits ( Davies and Gibling, 2010 ; Gibling and Davies, 2012 ). Th e greening of the continents by non-vascular plants may also have contributed to global glaciation in the Ordovician ( Lenton et al ., 2012 ). It seems like a big step to go from bare rock to bryophyte-covered rock to global glaciation; however, weathering experiments using modern descendants of the Ordovician plants support this bold claim. All plants require essential minerals for growth and development, which come either directly or indirectly from rocks—including potassium, phosphorous, calcium, magnesium, and iron. Lenton et al . ( 2012 ) conducted a series of mesocosm experiments with and without the moss Physcomitrella patens growing on bare basalt and andesite in order to test the ef- fects of moss growth on the weathering rates of calcium and magnesium silicates. Moss was found to increase the weathering of both elements by between ∼1.4 and ∼5 times the levels observed on rock with no moss. Th e weathering of calcium and magnesium silicates is one of the primary mechanisms of sequestering carbon from the atmosphere because the weathered silicates are carried to the oceans by rivers and react with seawater resulting in the precipitation of calcium and magnesium carbonate. It is suggested, therefore, that enhanced chemical weathering by the earliest non-vascular plants resulted in a sharp de- cline in atmospheric CO 2 concentration below a threshold that could have triggered global glaciation ( Lenton et al ., 2012 ).

Land surfaces were available for colonization by plants from an early point in Earth’s his- tory. However, other essential environmental prerequisites were still developing. Th ese included the formation of sizeable and stable near-shore environments, the formation of soils, and the development of suitable climatic and atmospheric conditions. 2. During the Cambrian and Ordovician (541–443 Ma) a combination of climate change and changing continental confi gurations resulted in widespread fl ooding of the conti- nental plates. Th is was then followed by a period of glaciation at the end of the Ordovi- cian (443 Ma), which led to a dramatic reduction in global sea levels and exposure of large areas of continental shelf. 3. Processes important for the early development of soils would have included atmos- pheric elemental input, and weathering by acid rain and organic acids produced by early microbial organisms. Geological evidence indicates that by the early Silurian (∼440 Ma) well-established soil profi les had developed. 4. Atmospheric concentrations during the Ordovician were very diff erent to present, with carbon dioxide 8–15 times higher than present and exceptionally low atmos- pheric oxygen (only 4 per cent compared to present day at 21 per cent). 5. From the lower Ordovician to early Silurian (∼475–430 Ma) evidence starts to emerge in the plant fossil record for the development of specialized cells for water and nutrient transport, various measures to protect against desiccation, mechanical support, and a reproductive mode that did not depend predominantly upon external water. Th ese morphological changes were essential prerequisites for land dwelling by plants. 6. Evidence for whole vascular land plant organs, such as stems and reproductive structures, starts to appear in the fossil record in the late Silurian/early Devonian (∼430–420 Ma). Th ese macrofossils (rather than the microfossils of single tubes, tracheids, spores, etc.) have been identifi ed from enough fossil localities to suggest that a vegetation of small- stature vascular plants had become established on many continents by this time. 7. Six examples of the most common early land plants found in the fossil record are: Cooksonia , Aglaophyton major , Rhynia gwynne-vaughanii , Zosterophyllum divarica- tum , Baragwanathia longifolia , and Psilophyton dawsonii . 8. Various lines of evidence, including biochemical, morphological, and molecular analy- ses of extant groups, in combination with evidence from the fossil record, indicate that the earliest land plants evolved from green algae and in particular the Charales group. Th ese earliest land-dwelling plants were most closely related to living bryophytes (mosses, liverworts, and hornworts), i.e. non-vascular. 9. Th ere is also increasing evidence to suggest that some of the earliest land-dwelling plants were in fact the green algae themselves. A number of extant groups of green algae occupy terrestrial habitats only requiring liquid water for reproduction and it is thought that this may well have also been the case early in Earth’s history. 03-WillisandMcElwain-Chap03.indd 9003-WillisandMcElwain-Chap03.indd 90 11/28/13 1:05 PM11/28/13 1:05 PM 91SUMMARY 10. Geological, morphological, and molecular evidence suggests that the earliest vascular plants occurred as a result of a lineage split from the hornworts. Th us, the closest rela- tives to the vascular plants are the hornworts. 11. Cladistic studies indicate that the early land plants can be divided broadly into three nested groups, the polysporangiophytes, the tracheophytes, and the eutracheophytes. Th e last group contains all extant vascular land plants and most vascular plant fossils, and it would appear from these studies that many of the characteristics that determine our present-day fl ora were fi rst established at least 430 million years ago. 12. Th e record of the earliest land plants is highly biased towards vascular plants. Th is bias is certainly due in part to the poor preservation potential of non-vascular plants (with less cuticle and other thickened parts). It is therefore usually assumed that the earliest terrestrial fl ora contained vascular plants (tracheophytes), non-vascular plants (bryo- phytes), and plants that had characteristics of both groups. 13. Five biogeographic regions can be recognized in fossil fl oras by the late Silurian–early Devonian (∼430–390 Ma). 14. Th e terrestrialization of land surfaces by plants had signifi cant impacts on the Earth system, including for example altering river drainage patterns, rates of erosion, at- mospheric concentrations of CO 2 and O 2 , and ultimately biogeochemical cycles. Th e climatic feedback resulting from these changes is thought to have been exten- sive, including providing the trigger for global glaciation at the end of the Ordovician (430 Ma). 03-WillisandMcElwain-Chap03.indd 9103-WillisandMcElwain-Chap03.indd 91 11/28/13 1:05 PM11/28/13 1:05 PM 4 The ﬁ rst forests Between 394 and 299 million years ago (mid Devonian to end Carboniferous) the terrestrial fl ora evolved from one composed of small vascular and non-vascular plants to a vegetation that included trees towering to over 35 m in height. During this time signifi cant changes were also occurring to the global environment. Th is chapter examines the evidence for these envi- ronmental and evolutionary changes and discusses the possible evolutionary pathways from the earliest vascular plants to trees. It concludes with a consideration of the biogeographical distribution of the fi rst multi-storied forests and the factors infl uencing their distribution. 4.1 Environmental changes spanning the mid Devonian to end Carboniferous (~394–299 Ma) Th e period between 394 and 299 Ma was one of active plate movement. It was also a time of dramatic global climatic change. Th e continental blocks that had formed the Gondwana and Laurussian groups during the Silurian ( Figure 3.1 ) moved northwards, resulting in forma- tion of the supercontinent Pangea by ~300 Ma consisting of a northern part, Laurasia, and a southern part, Gondwana ( Figure 4.1 ) ( Rowley et al. , 1985 ; Rogers and Santosh, 2004 ; Vázquez, 2010 ). Global climates during this interval in time can be divided into two distinct intervals. Th e fi rst, spanning the period 394–360 Ma, had warm, humid climates with high levels of atmospheric CO 2 . Between 360–299 Ma, global climates became increasingly cool and arid ( Crowley and North, 1991 ; Frakes et al. , 1992 ; Rogers and Santosh, 2004 ) resulting in extensive continental glaciations, enhanced precipitation at the equator, a large drop in atmospheric CO 2 , and a rise in atmospheric O 2 , as described below. Glaciation in mid to low latitude Th ere was a short period of glaciation from 360 Ma that resulted in ice cover along what is now Bolivia and parts of Brazil ( Isaacson et al. , 2008 ) but from ~350 Ma onwards, large ice sheets formed across what is now India, South America, Australia, and Antarctica resulting in a glacial epoch, the ‘Gondwana glacio-epoch’, that lasted until ~250 Ma ( Eyles, 2008 ). 04-WillisandMcElwain-Chap04.indd 9204-WillisandMcElwain-Chap04.indd 92 11/28/13 2:41 PM11/28/13 2:41 PM 934.1 ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES SPANNING THE MID DEVONIAN Th ere are a number of suggested causal mechanisms for this ice-house interval in Earth’s history, the majority of them related to continental plate movements. First, the collisions of Gondwana with Laurasia during the formation of Pangea would have resulted in extensive uplift at high southerly latitudes, leading to ice build-up on these higher landscapes ( Pujol et al. , 2006 ). Second, movements of the continental plates resulted in a change in the position of the South Pole in relation to the continent/ocean. Estimates suggest that by ~360 the South Pole was situated over the ocean and it is postulated that this would have caused signifi cant global cooling ( Rogers and Santosh, 2004 ) ( Figure 4.2 ) because the larger heat capacity of the Figure 4.1 Palaeogeographic maps showing continental plate changes between 390 and 299 million years ago during the assembly of Pangea.

Th ird, the packing of the continental blocks to form Pangea would have altered the fl ow of equatorial currents that distribute warm water, resulting in cooling of the continental interior ( Rogers and Santosh, 2004 ). Th is would have led to the formation of a large southern hemisphere ice sheet, with in- creasingly cool and arid conditions in continental interiors. During times of glaciation, tem- peratures were signifi cantly cooler, sea levels were lowered by an estimated 120 m ( Haq and Schutter, 2008 ; Rygel et al. , 2008 ), and there was aridity in the high latitudes ( Aitken, 1985 ). Enhanced precipitation in narrow equatorial belt In addition to continental climates becoming generally drier from ~360 Ma, fossil evidence also suggests that precipitation became enhanced in a narrow equatorial belt ( Raymond, 1985 , 1987 ; Raymond and Metz, 2004 ). High year-round wetness in this tropical belt is thought to have been partially responsible for the development of extensive lowland swamps, resulting in the formation of coal deposits in eastern North America, western Europe, and parts of Russia during the Carboniferous ( Ziegler et al. , 1987 ; Chaloner and Creber, 1988 , 1990 ; Raymond and Metz, 2004 ). Continental plate movements and global climate circula- tory patterns are thought to have been responsible for this belt of enhanced precipitation ( Condie and Sloan, 1998 ; Otto-Bliesner, 1998 ). In addition it has been suggested that during the glacial intervals, the high pressure cells associated with the very cold poles would have Figure 4.2 Postulated polar wander across Gondwana during the Carboniferous and Permian (~360–248 Ma).

Both of these factors would have enhanced local precipitation in palaeoequatorial latitudes. 90 per cent drop in atmospheric CO 2 Another factor aff ecting the global climates between 395–299 Ma was related to the widespread colonization of the land by plants. Estimates of atmospheric CO 2 in the period before 360 Ma indicate that levels were up to 8–9 times higher than those of the present day ( Figure 4.3 ); in fact, at their highest level in the past 400 million years ( Berner, 1998 , 2006 ; McElwain and Chaloner, Figure 4.3 Estimated variations in atmospheric CO 2 during the past 600 million years.

Th is would have had a considerable eff ect on global warmth through an en- hanced greenhouse eff ect. However, between 360–299 Ma models and proxy data indicate that atmospheric CO 2 levels plummeted from 3600 ppm to 300 ppm, such that by the late Carbon- iferous, levels of atmospheric CO 2 were comparable to those of the present day ( Berner, 2006 ) ( Figure 4.3 ). One of the main processes thought to be responsible for this rapid decline was the global expansion of vascular plants and the eff ect that they would have had on the acceleration of silicate rock weathering and the production of bacterially resistant organic matter (e.g. lignin) ( Schidlowski, 1983 ; Berner, 2006 ; Bergman et al. , 2004 ; Algeo and Scheckler, 1998 ). It is envisaged that the widespread colonization of land surfaces by vascular plants and their associated release of organic acids (e.g. humic and fl uvic acids released through root mycorrhi- zae) would have greatly increased chemical weathering of silicate rocks ( Algeo and Scheckler, 1998 ; Figure 4.4 ). Th is process is one that uses atmospheric CO 2 (CO 2 + CaSiO 3 ↔ CaCO 3 + SiO 2 ), resulting in a transfer of carbon from the atmosphere to silicate minerals. Th ese would then be washed away and eventually deposited as carbonate minerals on the ocean fl oor where they would subsequently become buried and therefore removed from the atmospheric pool ( Berner, 1997 , 1998 , 2006 ). In addition, it is suggested that the large increases in plant organic matter composed of organic polymers such as lignin in vascular tissue, which were highly (a) Pre-Devonian (<395 Ma) (b) Late Devonian (>370 Ma)1 : 1 ATM. and soil Long-term steady state Excess soil pCO2 Soil ATM.CO2 pumpingRate of CO2 utilization(weathering)1 : 1Long-term steady stateRate of CO2 utilization(weathering) Figure 4.4 Hypothesized contribution of vascular plant evolution to long-term trends in atmospheric CO 2 concentration. (a) In the pre-Devonian world, non-vascular land plants and cyanobacterial crusts had only a small inﬂ uence on chemical weathering processes resulting in a comparatively minimal draw-down of atmospheric CO 2 by chemical weathering processes. (b) In the late Devonian, plant-driven chemical weathering processes were accelerated due to the evolution of deep roots, ligniﬁ ed vascular tissue, and an expansion of plant geographical coverage and biomass. This resulted in CO 2 being ‘pumped’ or sequestered into the soil system and eventually deposited as carbonates in the oceans. Modiﬁ ed from Thomas J. Algeo and Stephen E.

Th is would have led to a scenario where rates of accumulation would have exceeded those of de- composition ( Robinson, 1991 ). Burial of these vast quantities of organic material would again have resulted in the removal of carbon from the atmosphere, but this time by locking it away in long-term carbon sinks, such as coal. Peak atmospheric O 2 levels Th e late Devonian to end Carboniferous period is also characterized by a remarkable trend of increasing atmospheric oxygen (O 2 ), reaching maximum levels known in Earth history by around 280 Ma (earliest Permian – also see Chapter 5 ). Model estimates indicate peak levels of O 2 of between 28 and 30 per cent compared with modern-day levels of 20.9 per cent ( Bergman et al. , 2004 ; Berner, 2006 ; Glasspool and Scott, 2010 ; Figure 4.5 ). Spontaneous combustion of organic material was likely widespread under such superoxic conditions, even in the wettest of habitats such as peat swamps, because fossil charcoal is globally abundant indicating that fi re was prevalent worldwide ( Glasspool and Scott, 2010 ). Enhanced burial of organic matter, par- ticularly the burial of vast quantities of vascular land plant biomass in the tropical peatlands, is thought to be one of the main drivers of increasing O 2 . According to the following equation, CO 2 + H 2 O ↔ CH 2 O + O 2 , which represents photosynthesis on short time-scales and organic carbon burial on long time-scales (going from left to right), every molecule of biomass (CH 2 O) buried prevents decomposition back to CO 2 and H 2 O, leaving behind a molecule of O 2 to accu- mulate in the atmosphere. Continuous burial of relatively undecomposed land plant biomass for millions of years resulted in the long-term draw-down of atmospheric CO 2 and remarkable Figure 4.5 Changes in the ratio of atmospheric oxygen to carbon dioxide over the past 550 million years based on model estimates from the GEOCARBSULF model of Berner ( 2006 ) and the COPSE model of Bergman et al.

Th e contrasting patterns of these two important atmospheric gases are best demonstrated by examining trends of O 2 :CO 2 ratio through the interval ( Figure 4.5 ). Th ey reveal a steeply climbing trend, from O 2 levels only 45 times higher than CO 2 in the mid Devonian (390 Ma) to levels that are between 280 and 780 times higher than CO 2 by the late Carboniferous (~300 Ma). It has been widely hypothesized that gigantism in insects from this period is attributable to elevated O 2 because the diff usion path for insect respiration would be longer, allowing increased body size, and because the atmosphere would be denser, thus sup- porting fl ight of larger-bodied organisms ( Dudley, 1998 ; Harrison et al. , 2010 ). 4.2 Major changes and innovations in the plant fossil record during the mid Devonian to end Carboniferous (~394–299 Ma) Evolutionary innovations that occurred during the intervals 394–299 Ma took place against a backdrop of major environmental change. From ~360 Ma some regions (e.g. those close to the poles) were experiencing aridity and intense cold, whereas other regions had warm and humid conditions (e.g. equatorial areas). All regions would have experienced the large drop in atmospheric CO 2 and coincident rise in atmospheric O 2 and globally sea levels were lower- ing by up to ~150 m, exposing large areas of continental shelf. During the period spanning the middle to late Devonian (~394–360 Ma) there was the emergence of new plant groups, and a relatively rapid increase in species numbers ( Niklas et al. , 1985a ) ( Figure 4.6 ).

Th is pattern of increasing diversity was not to last, however, and by the late Devonian (~360 Ma), the number of new species started to plateau such that there were less originations than extinctions, leading to a slight drop in overall species number ( Raymond and Metz, 1995 ). Th is reduction in overall species number occurred at a time (late Devonian, Frasnian/Famennian) when there was a mass extinction event in the animal record. Th e plant fossil record also indicates that major innovations were occurring in land plant morphology between 394–360 Ma ( Chaloner, 1967 ; Chaloner and Sheerin, 1979 ; Gensel and Andrews, 1987 ; Niklas, 1997 ; Algeo and Scheckler, 1998 ; Taylor et al. , 2009 ). In par- ticular, terrestrial plants were getting much bigger and acquiring more refi ned reproductive systems. Th ere is also evidence for the evolution of a more advanced vascular system for the transport of water and nutrients, additional supporting mechanisms, advanced rooting systems, and leaves. Evolution of these features would have facilitated the large increases in vascular plant size, structure, complexity, and reproductive potential. However, it was not until the dramatic reduction in CO 2 from 370 Ma that one of the most visually notable evo- lutionary innovations occurred: the evolution of the megaphyll leaf ( Beerling et al. , 2001 ). Th e fossil evidence for these morphological changes will be discussed fi rst, followed by a description of some of the earliest trees on Earth and their biogeographical distribution. 4.3 Evidence of further plant adaptations to land dwelling between mid Devonian and end Carboniferous (~394–299 Ma) Advanced vascular system (stelar evolution) In order to attain greater height, one of the most important adaptations would have been the development of the central conducting cylinder (the stele) for the eff ective transport of water and nutrients around the plant ( Stewart and Rothwell, 1993 ; Niklas, 1997 ; Taylor and Taylor, 2009 ; Spicer and Groover, 2010 ). Evidence from the geological record suggests that the stele of plants became progressively more complex with time and that by the middle Devonian (~390 Ma) at least three diff erent stele types were apparent. Protostele Th e earliest stele found in the fossil record is the protostele, found in most of the earliest vascular plants ( Chapter 3 ) and also some early lycopsids and sphenopsids ( see Section 4.5 ). Th is stele ( Figure 4.7 a) is composed of a solid strand of vascular tissue in which phloem (food-conducting tissue) either surrounds the xylem (water and mineral-conducting tissue) or is interspersed within it. Siphonostele A more complex stele, termed the siphonostele ( Figure 4.7 b), became apparent in the geo- logical record in the Emsian (~407 Ma). Th is stele was made up of xylem and phloem form- ing a cylinder around a central core fi lled with pith, and has been found in fossil fi licopsids, lycopsids, and some sphenopsids ( see Section 4.5 ). 04-WillisandMcElwain-Chap04.indd 9904-WillisandMcElwain-Chap04.indd 99 11/28/13 2:41 PM11/28/13 2:41 PM 100 4 THE FIRST FORESTS Eustele A third stele type, termed the eustele ( Figure 4.7 c), fi rst emerged in the fossil record at ~390 Ma. Th is stele appears to be the most complex of the three structures in that it was composed of distinct strands of phloem and xylem, separated by parenchymal tissue. Th ese strands were arranged either in a circle or throughout the ground tissue ( Taylor and Taylor, 2009 ). Th e eustele fi rst occurred in the progymnosperms (the precursor to the seed plants). Evidence from the geological record thus suggests that the stele of plants became pro- gressively more complex with time. It is also notable that with increased stelar complexity there was an increase in stem diameter and height. As shown in the previous chapter, the earliest vascular land plants were small and narrow-stemmed, and the transport of water and nutrients in the plants occurred through specialized tracheids. Th e central stem there- fore contained the tissue for support, transport of water/nutrients, and also photosynthesis. Calculations indicate that the best arrangement of tissue for these three functions would have been a photosynthetic ‘rind’ of tissue just beneath the surface of the stem and a cen- tral water-conducting strand running through an inner core of non-photosynthetic tissue ( Niklas, 1997 ). Th is type of arrangement is seen in the protostele, where the xylem cells would have provided mechanical support and the phloem cells would have transported sugars and nutrients. Th ese two layers were then surrounded by an outer layer of photosyn- thetic tissue ( Figure 4.7 a). However, calculations indicate that in order to attain greater heights the required thick- ness of the xylem cells (to provide mechanical support) would eventually present a barrier between the photosynthetic and water-conducting tissues. Th erefore, beyond a certain size it would have been necessary to compartmentalize functions of the plant body into organs devoted to photosynthesis and organs devoted to mechanical support and water conduction ( Niklas, 1986 , 1997 ). Increasing complexity of the stele ( Figure 4.7 ) in combination with innovations in supporting mechanisms and the evolution of true leaves (discussed in the sections ‘Additional supporting mechanisms’ and ‘Leaves’) are therefore regarded as funda- mental to the evolution of arborescence (a woody habit) in plants ( Speck and Vogellehner, 1988 ; Algeo and Scheckler, 1998 ). Ultimately this would lead to the appearance of the fi rst well-stratifi ed forested ecosystems on Earth. Additional supporting mechanisms Trees in extant fl ora display a variety of diff erent supporting mechanisms, ranging from thickening of the trunk with wood and bark, to above-ground root mantles and extensive Figure 4.7 Morphological differences between the early stele types apparent in the plant fossil record: (a) protostele, apparent in the earliest vascular plants from ~420 Ma; (b) siphonostele, apparent in the fossil record from ~407 Ma; (c) eustele, apparent in the fossil record from ~390 Ma.

Fossil evidence suggests that many of these supporting mechanisms developed from as early as 390 Ma. Probably the most common form of sup- port for extant trees is achieved by thickening of the trunk through the growth of wood. Wood results from the growth of secondary xylem and phloem from lateral meristematic zones known as the vascular cambium ( Raven et al. , 1992 ). Evidence from the fossil record suggests that the formation of secondary xylem and phloem enabled some of the earliest known trees (e.g. Archaeopteris , see ‘Progymnosperms’ in Section 4.5 ) to achieve heights of up to 30 m ( Meyer-Berthaud et al. , 1999 ). However, palaeobotanical evidence indicates that in other early trees, thickening of the trunk for increased stature was achieved in other ways. Th ese included the development of large quantities of inner bark (usually referred to as secondary cortex) ( Th omas and Spicer, 1987 ; Taylor and Taylor, 1993 ; Taylor et al. , 2009 ) and the development of greatly thickened stems as a result of numerous leaf bases (e.g. Lepidodendron , see ‘Lycophytes’ in Section 4.5 ). Another mechanism for support appears to have been the development of abundant mantles of roots that were thickest at the base of the trunk. Th ese would have acted as guy-ropes, teth- ering the tree to the ground and enabling much greater stature to be achieved (e.g. Psaronius , see ‘Filicopsids’ in Section 4.5 ). In addition to above-ground root mantles, evidence from palaeosols (fossil soils) indicates the development of numerous short roots/rhizomes (<10 cm) from the early Devonian ~410 Ma ( Algeo and Sheckler, 2010 ). By ~390 Ma there is evidence in the fossil record for large, deeply penetrating root systems extending up to 1 m into the substrate ( Meyer- Berthaud et al ., 1999 ; Driese et al ., 1997 ; Retallack, 1997 ) ( Figure 4.8 ). At least seven mor- phologically distinguishable below-ground rooting systems have been recorded in Devonian and Carboniferous paleosols ( Bockelie, 1994 ). Th ese ranged from highly branched systems to small annulated-segmented roots from which long root hairs grew at the point of segmenta- tion. Th e rooting systems would have been vital for both support and the increased uptake of water and nutrients. Th ey would also have had a signifi cant impact on weathering rates and processes, increasing the depth of mature soil profi les ( Algeo and Scheckler, 1998 , 2010 ; Figure 4.4 ). Leaves Th e earliest land plants possessed stomata and cuticles in their stems and were therefore photosynthesizing from these leafl ess axes. For at least the fi rst 40 million years of their exist- ence, land plants were therefore leafl ess or had only small, spine-like appendages ( Kenrick, 2001 ). However, leaf-like structures and true leaves, primarily devoted to and optimized for the photosynthetic process, started to appear in the fossil record from the mid to late Devo- nian (~390–354 Ma), respectively. Th ere were two early forms of leaf type—microphylls and megaphylls—which are thought to have diff erent evolutionary origins ( Boyce, 2010 ) and the diff erences between them can still be seen in plant groups today. Microphylls Th ese are generally relatively small leaves (although there are exceptions) that grow out di- rectly from the stem. Th ey contain only a single strand of unbranching vascular tissue and tend to be associated with stems possessing protosteles. It is proposed that they evolved 04-WillisandMcElwain-Chap04.indd 10104-WillisandMcElwain-Chap04.indd 101 11/28/13 2:41 PM11/28/13 2:41 PM 102 4 THE FIRST FORESTS Figure 4.8 Relative sizes, shapes, and penetration depths of root systems during the early, middle, and late Devonian (~400–354 Ma; age axis is not drawn to scale).

Th e ‘Enation theory’ ( Bower, 1935 ) proposed that microphyll leaves evolved from the spiny stems of the earliest land plants, such as Sawdonia . Lateral outgrowth of vascular tissue into the spines (enations) resulted in the spines ‘fl eshing out’ and the formation of microphyllous leaves ( Figure 4.9 a(i)). Th e ‘Telome theory’ ( Zimmerman, 1952 ), on the other hand, sug- gested that microphylls represented the end product of an evolutionary series of reduction from once-forked side branches, which became aligned (planation) ( Figure 4.9 a(ii)). Th is latter theory, however, is now thought to be increasingly unlikely in terms of plant develop- ment and the way that vascular tissue develops ( Boyce, 2008 ).

Megaphylls Th ese are leaves associated with stems that have either a siphonostele or eustele, and are attached to the stem by a petiole ( Figure 4.7 ) (for a review see Tomescu, 2008 ). Th eir evolu- tion is thought to be closely linked to the three-dimensional vegetative branching pattern (i.e. branches with no sporangia on them) of the earliest vascular plants (e.g. Psilophyton dawsonii , Figure 3.19 ). According to the Telome theory ( Zimmerman, 1952 ), megaphylls are thought to have evolved by a fusion of these non-fertile branches, with undiff erentiated tissue forming webbing between the branches. Th e former branches would thus provide vascular tissue into the megaphyll leaf, resulting in the evolution of a broad leaf containing many vascular strands ( Figure 4.9 b). Th ree stages were thought to have occurred in the evo- lution of the megaphylls, each resulting from genetic modifi cation ( Boyce, 2008 ; Tomescu, 2008 ; Boyce, 2010 ; Pires and Dolan, 2012 ). Th ese were: i) overtopping or the formation of determinate lateral branch systems; ii) planation or the fl attening of three-dimensional stem segments into a single plane; and iii) webbing or infi lling of the branches by thin outgrowths of photosynthetic mesophyll tissue (for a review see Beerling and Fleming, 2007 ). Megaphyll leaves have evolved independently in nine Euphyllophyte clades ( Tomescu, 2008 ). Early fos- sil and extant fi licopsids (ferns), a number of extinct sphenopsids (horsetails), and gymno- sperms and the majority of fl owering plants possess megaphylls. Studies based on morphological observations and modelling of the biophysical principles of plant physiology suggest that evolution of the megaphyll leaf may have occurred in response to the massive reduction in atmospheric CO 2 during the late Devonian and early Carboniferous ( Robinson, 1991 ; Beerling et al. , 2001 ; Beerling and Fleming, 2007 ). It is suggested that in the high CO 2 world of the early and mid Devonian (~417–370 Ma), the evolution of a megaphyll leaf would have been detrimental to plant survival, as leaf temperatures would have exceeded lethal threshold limits ( Boyce and Knoll, 2002 ; Osborne et al. , 2004a ). It was not, therefore, until the late Devonian/early Carboniferous (~359 Ma), when CO 2 levels plummeted, that increased leaf size would have been advantageous to land plants ( Beerling et al. , 2001 ). 4.4 Further adaptations to the plant life cycle Alongside the morphological innovations that were taking place in plant vegetative struc- tures, the period between 395 and 299 Ma (early Devonian to late Carboniferous) saw the evolution of the fi rst true seeds, advancement in pollen evolution, and further signifi cant modifi cations in plant reproductive strategy. Evolution of the seed habit revolutionized the plant life cycle by freeing plants from the necessity of external water for sexual reproduction and by aff ording protection and providing nutrients to the developing embryo. Th ese three functions enabled plants with the seed habit to expand their geographical extent beyond the confi nes of stream sides and sources of water, and to exploit drier, upland, and primary suc- cessional environments ( Algeo and Scheckler, 1998 ; Algeo and Scheckler, 2010 ). 04-WillisandMcElwain-Chap04.indd 10404-WillisandMcElwain-Chap04.indd 104 11/28/13 2:41 PM11/28/13 2:41 PM 1054.4 FURTHER ADAPTATIONS TO THE PLANT LIFE CYCLE In order to examine fossil evidence for seed evolution, which was arguably the single most important innovation in embryophytes, it is important fi rst to simply ask: what is a seed? Technically, a seed is a fertilized ovule, so the terms ovule and seed will be used interchange- ably in the following sections. Th e seed-habit is a heterosporous form of reproduction in plants ( Gerrienne et al. , 2004 ) and fossil evidence for the transition between homosporous and heterosporous reproduction will also be reviewed in detail. Finally, in order to identify the earliest seed in the fossil record the traits that separate true seeds from plants with a het- erosporous habit must also be recognized. A true seed must have all of the following traits ( Gerrienne et al. , 2004 ): (1) there can only be one female megaspore per megasporangium (referred to as monomegaspory); (2) the female megaspore must be retained within an in- dehiscent megasporangium (called a nucellus), that is, one that does not burst open when mature (this trait is referred to as endomegasporangy); (3) the indehiscent megasporangium should be further protected within a seed coat (referred to as integumentation); (4) the in- tegumented megasporangium must be retained on the maternal plant and further protected within a cup-like structure called the cupule; and (5) the pollen containing the male sperm must be captured before the seed is dispersed. Homospory to heterospory Evidence from the fossil plant record indicates that plants were producing sporangia yield- ing two kinds of spores ( Figure 4.10 ) from the early Devonian (Emsian, ~407 Ma) onwards. Th ese include megaspores that were between approximately 150 and 200 μm in diameter and microspores that were usually <50 μm ( Traverse, 1988a , b ). Th e transition from plants that were homosporous (one spore size) to heterosporous (two spore sizes) is considered Figure 4.10 Spore sizes in the geological record, indicating that a transition from one (homospory) to two (heterospory) spore sizes occurred from the early Devonian (~400 Ma).

It is postulated that the larger spores of heterosporous plants were the precursor of ovules, and the small spores were the precursor to pollen ( Figure 4.11 ). Th ere is much discussion in the literature as to the formation of megaspores. Th e most widely accepted theory is that mutation resulted in two spore sizes developing in a spo- rangium ( Th omas and Spicer, 1987 ). Evidence from the geological record would appear to support this theory in that records of dispersed spores of two size classes (anispory) indicate a gradual increase in occurrence of heterospory through the Devonian ( Chaloner, 1967 ) ( Figure 4.10 ). An early example in the fossil record of a heterosporous plant is Chaleuria ( Gensel and Andrews, 1984 , 1987 ). Specimens of this late Devonian plant have been shown to contain two types of sporangia, those that produce spores between 30 and 48 μm and oth- ers that produce spores between 60 and 156 μm ( Taylor et al. , 2009 ).

Retention of the mega- spore in the megasporangium was the fi rst step towards evolution of the ovule ( Chaloner and Hemsley, 1991 ; Hemsley, 1993 ). Th e second step would have been the development of a seed coat. A good fossil example of advanced heterospory is the lycopsid Sphinxia ( Li et al. , 1997 ) found in the Late Devonian (~380 Ma) ( Figure 4.13 ). Most but not all of its megasporangia contain a single megaspore. Th e megaspore is protected by integument-like tissue; however, there is no conspicuous modifi cation of the integument for pollen capture (as in Figure 4.13 ).

Th is would have protected the megasporangium from desiccation and attack. According to taxonomic nomenclature, once an outer coat or integument has formed around a megasporangium, it technically becomes an ovule, since in structure it now represents an unfertilized seed ( Linkies et al. , 2010 ). Th ere are various theories relating to the evolution of the seed coat, most of them suggesting that the integument formed through some aspect of development of the outer coat of the sporangia (reviewed in Taylor et al. , 2009 ). Th e most widely accepted theory, however, is that seed coats resulted from the envelopment of the megasporangium by sterile photosynthetic stems (telome trusses), which fused around the megasporangium to encase it, so forming an ovule ( Figure 4.14 ) ( Th omas and Spicer, 1987 ; Taylor and Taylor, 1993 ). Many of the early ovules were further enveloped by stalked cupules, with up to four ovules within a cupule. Again, the cupule was thought to have developed from fusion of a vegetative branching system. One of the earliest examples of a fossil plant with an integumented megasporangium contained within a cupule is Runcaria from mid Devonian-aged sediments from Belgium (385 Ma). It has been interpreted as a seed precursor as it has some but not all of the traits of a true seed; in particular it lacks a pollen chamber and an opening in the tip of the megasporangium known as a lagenostome ( Gerrienne et al. , 2004 ). It is an important fossil as it constrains the time line for the evolu- tion of the entire seed plant lineage to between 385 Ma (the age of Runcaria ) and 365 Ma, which is the age of the earliest known true fossil seed ( Figure 4.15 ). Development of pollen reception mechanisms With the encasement of the ovule in a seed coat, it would have been necessary to develop a mechanism by which the pollen could reach the egg of the archegonia contained within the ovule, for germination. In the earliest seeds, where the integumentary envelope was only fused at the base ( see Figure 4.14 c), there is evidence for evolution of various elabo- rate structures at the neck and tip of the megasporangium including an opening called the lagenostome to allow entry of pollen into the megasporangium and a pollen chamber. In eff ect, these acted as a funnel to channel the pollen towards the archegonia within the ovule ( Figure 4.16 a). In contrast fossilized seed precursors such as Runcaria did not possess such Figure 4.14 Development of the seed coat from sterile telome trusses.

Th ese pollen-receiving struc- tures, in combination with the lobes of the seed coat and cupules, would have been highly eff ective in trapping wind-borne pollen ( Taylor and Millay, 1979 ). Wind tunnel experiments attempting to reconstruct the aerodynamics of these structures ( Niklas, 1983 ) have indi- cated, for example, that lobed integuments would have off ered a large surface area to capture airborne pollen ( Niklas, 1997 ) ( Figure 4.16 a). However, some of the earliest ovules had much simpler mechanisms for attracting pol- len, including hairs that lined both the inside and outside of the integumentary lobes ( Figure 4.16 b) and pollination droplets ( Figure 4.16 c). Pollination droplets were composed of a sticky material that exuded from tentacle-like projections situated on the outside of the integument, to which pollen became stuck ( Th omas and Spicer, 1987 ; Taylor and Taylor, 1993 ; Taylor et al. , 2009 ). Some early examples of true fossil seeds include Elkinsia polymor- pha and Moresnetia zaleskyi ( Figure 4.15 ), both of which date to 365 Ma. In extant seed plants, the seed coat is fully enclosed, resulting from the fusion of the in- tegumentary lobes with each other and the nucellus. Th ere is a clearly defi ned hole in the top of the seed (a terminal pore) called the micropyle, and it is through this that pollen or Figure 4.15 An illustration of the timing of seed plant evolution demonstrating the key morphological features that deﬁ ne true seeds as in (2) from fossil seed precursors as in (1).

In extant gymnosperms, for example, a sugary ‘pollination drop’ exudes from the micropyle in which wind-blown pollen becomes trapped. As the pollination drop is withdrawn back into the nucellus, the pollen is taken in with it ( Bell, 1992 ). Evidence in the fossil record suggests that development of an enclosed integument and as- sociated micropyle occurred in the late Devonian. Th e advantages of an enclosed integument were threefold ( Niklas, 1997 ). First, it would have provided much greater protection to the megasporangium against predators and desiccation. Secondly, it would have increased the effi - ciency of wind pollination; a more fused morphology and reduced lobes would have conferred aerodynamic effi ciency for defl ecting windborne pollen into the pollen drop, and thence into the micropyle. Th irdly, it would have aided the dispersal of mature seeds. Th e evolution of true seeds would therefore have enabled a much greater chance of lateral dispersal away from the parent plant ( Chaloner, 1967 ; Niklas, 1997 ) and greater potential for survival, once dispersed, in the newly created, drier, primary successional environments ( Algeo and Scheckler, 1998 ). Heterospory to pre-pollen to pollen Innovations in male reproductive biology occurred in tandem with the evolution of the seed. With the advent of seed plants the male gametophyte became highly reduced in size Figure 4.16 Development of pollen reception mechanisms visible in the fossil record: (a) adaptation of funnels to channel pollen towards the ovule; (b) hairs; (c) schematic diagram to indicate the ‘pollination drop’ mechanism.

In seed plants the delivery of male sex cells to the female counterpart (archegonium in the ovule) was fa- cilitated by the evolution of pre-pollen, followed by true pollen ( Friedman, 1993 ; Poort et al. , 1996 ). Pollen is distinguishable from spores in both structure/size and the method by which gametes are released ( Traverse, 1988b ). In many extant heterosporous plant groups (e.g. Selaginella ), microspores germinate away from the parent plant into small gametophytes, which liberate fl agellated sperm from the antheridia, which then swim to the archegonia for fertilization. In the earliest seed plants the male gametophyte developed fully within the pre-pollen grain. Pre-pollen would have been trapped within the pollen chamber of early seeds, whereupon motile sperm were released by rupture of the proximal aperture ( Figure 4.17 and 4.18 ). Later in the fossil record there is evidence for true pollen grains with a distal aperture (leptoma) from which a single pollen tube developed. Th e earliest pollen grains had both proximal and distal apertures suggesting that motile sperm were still released from the proximal aperture and that the function of the pollen tube was almost parasitic on the female, deriving nutrients for the developing sperm. Only later is there evidence for fos- sil pollen grains with only distal apertures, indicating that pollen was delivered directly to the female archegonia via the pollen tube ( Figure 4.17 ). Th is process of pollen delivery is Figure 4.17 Schematic diagram to illustrate the evolution of pollen morphology and fertilization strategies evident in the plant fossil record (Poort et al . 1996).

In extant seed plants, cycads and ginkgos are zoidogamous but all other seed plants have siphonogamous pollination mechanisms (reviewed in Poort et al. , 1996 ). Th e earliest pollen grains evident in the fossil record (termed ‘pre-pollen’) are halfway between pollen and spores. Th ey contain morphological features of spores, such as the trilete scar, but evidence suggests that germination occurred on or very near to the opening of the megasporangium ( Traverse, 1988b ). By the late Carboniferous (~310 Ma), however, at least two morphologically distinct pollen types were present in the fossil record ( Traverse, 1988b ). One kind was saccate (i.e. it had either one or two bladder sacs attached to the grain) and germination occurred from its distal end (i.e. away from the centre of the original tetrad). Th is type of pollen is morphologically similar to extant gymnosperm pollen ( Figure 4.18 ). Th e other type consisted of a single grain with a long suture running down the distal edge, presumably from where germination occurred. Th is morphological type of pollen grain is known as monolete. Both monosaccate and monolete pollen in the early fossil record are attributed to members of the pteridosperms and cordaites ( see Section 4.5 ). Interestingly, both types of morphology in pollen grains are still apparent today. In summary, therefore, it is apparent that throughout the early Devonian, major inno- vations were occurring in vascular plant morphology. Th ese would not only have enabled greatly increased size and stature but also the ability to reproduce and survive in more arid environments over a wider geographic distribution ( Chaloner and Sheerin, 1979 ; Niklas, 1997 ; Algeo and Scheckler, 1998 ). Th ese innovations occurred during a dramatic transition- ary phase in global climates, moving from a period of high global temperatures and high at- mospheric CO 2 to one of cold glacial climates, with a rapid and major decline in atmospheric Figure 4.18 (a) Earliest spores with trilete scar; (b) saccate pollen, with two bladder sacs attached to the grain; (c) monolete pollen, with a long suture running down the distal edge.

However, these climate changes did not merely provide a background to vascular plant evolution but, rather, vascular plant evolution played a signifi cant role in altering the global climates. Terrestrialization of the Earth resulted in a draw-down of atmospheric CO 2 , which in turn contributed to global climatic cooling ( Robinson, 1991 ; Berner, 1997 , 1998 ) and a dramatic increase in atmospheric oxygen to peak levels known in Earth history. Th e fossil record provides evidence for increasing seed size and volume from the time of the earliest seeds into the Carboniferous ( Tiff ney, 2004 ). Th e potential driving mechanism of seed size enlargement through evolutionary time has been widely debated. Chaloner and Sheerin ( 1981 ) proposed that the pattern could refl ect a shift in the ecology within sperma- tophytes (seed plants), the earliest seed plants being opportunistic with high reproductive output of small seeds ( r strategists), which was followed later by a switch over to a more equilibrium strategy ( K strategists), with greater overall plant biomass, longer life spans, and lower reproductive output of larger seeds. An alternative possibility is that maximum seed volume observed in the late Carboniferous (318 to 299 Ma) could be in part due to elevated atmospheric O 2 levels during this period ( Figures 4.5 ). Sexual reproduction in plants is one of the most energy demanding processes known, thus requiring oxygen for respiration. Ex- periments under modern atmospheric O 2 concentration of 20.9 per cent have shown that very bulky plant tissue can become anoxic ( Geigenberger, 2003 ). Perhaps, therefore, the very high O 2 atmosphere of the Carboniferous lift ed a constraint on seed size, permitting seed size to grow to the largest observed in Earth history. Th e possibility of seed size gigantism due to high O 2 has not been considered but is a worthy avenue of future research. 4.5 Earliest trees in the fossil record Th e term ‘earliest trees’ must be used fairly loosely since the record of when and where the fi rst trees were located is strongly infl uenced by the fact that certain regions provided better preservation potential, such as in areas of lowland swamps, and therefore the record is some- what biased. However, two irrefutable facts emerge about the vegetation of this time. First, the earliest arborescent forms of plants (trees) appeared in the middle Devonian (~385 Ma). Second, from this time until the late Carboniferous, forests composed of spore-producing trees plus two groups of early seed-producing trees dominated large regions of the continents. Earliest spore-producing trees Th e spore-producing trees that evolved during this interval (~385–299 Ma) can be classifi ed into fi ve major evolutionary groups or clades based on diff erences and similarities in their DNA sequences and morphology: namely lycopsids, which belong to the Lycophyte clade, sphenopsids and fi licopsids, which belong to the Monilophyte clade, progymnosperms, which belong to the Lignophyte clade, and the Pseudosprochnus clade (Pseudosprochnales) ( Pryer et al. , 2001 ; Qiu et al. , 2006 ; Judd et al. , 2008 ; Stein et al. , 2007 ). Th e progymnosperms and Pseudosprochnales are both extinct, but the other three groups all have extant members, indicating the remarkable longevity of these clades in the fossil record. It is beyond the scope of this book to describe in detail all fossil members of each group (for full descriptions see, for example, Phillips and DiMichele, 1992 ; Stewart and Rothwell, 1993 ; Taylor et al. , 2009 ; Cleal 04-WillisandMcElwain-Chap04.indd 11304-WillisandMcElwain-Chap04.indd 113 11/28/13 2:41 PM11/28/13 2:41 PM 114 4 THE FIRST FORESTS and Th omas, 2009 ). However, the morphological traits that defi ne each major clade, plus one common fossil species with a tree habit from each, are described in the following section to provide a preliminary picture of the trees that formed the canopy in the earliest fossil forests. Gilboa tree ( Pseudosprochnus ) In 2007, the identity of in situ tree stumps from Gilboa in New York was revealed, making ‘Gilboa tree’ the earliest known fossil tree in Earth history. Th e fossilized tree stumps are middle Devo- nian in age dating to ~385 Ma and consist of tree trunks up to 8 metres in height with a crown of leafl ess photosynthetic branches arranged in longitudinal rows and shed as whole frond/branch Figure 4.19 A reconstruction of Pseudosprochnus showing: (a) habit of whole tree; (b) detail of bark and attachment of side branches; (c) architecture of non-fertile side branches; (d) detail of fertile branches showing pairs of sporangia; (e) close-up of sporangia.

Th e photosynthetic branches of Pseudosprochnus had long been known in the fossil record under the generic name Wattieza . Similarly the trunk of Pseudosprochnus was also known as the form genus Eospermatopteris . Th e new fossil fi nds were the fi rst where the branches and trunk were found in connection with each other, helping to reconstruct all of the pieces as a whole tree. Th e evolutionary position of Gilboa tree is not fully resolved but it is thought to represent a mor- phological link between the earliest vascular plants and extant Monilophytes (ferns and equi- setophytes) ( Stein et al. , 2007 ; Figure 4.20 ). Investigation of the sedimentary environment in which the fossil stumps were discovered suggested that Pseudosprochnus was adapted to water- logged and likely poorly oxygenated conditions. Th e spacing of fossil stumps indicate that this tree could have formed partial or compact canopies in some settings; however, it is likely that the canopies intercepted much less light than do modern tree-fern forests because of the leafl ess na- ture of the canopy branches. It is thought to be unlikely that tree stature in Pseudosprochnus was selected for increased light interception ( Meyer-Berthaud and Decombeix, 2007 ). Instead it is suggested that tree stature would have facilitated wide dissemination of reproductive propagules ( Niklas, 1997 ; Meyer-Berthaud and Decombeix, 2007 ). Pseudosprochnus was not, however, long lived as a genus and appears to have gone extinct by the late Devonian. Progymnosperms (Aneurophytales, Archaeopteridales, Protopityales) Progymnosperms are well represented in the fossil record, with 15–20 fossil genera. Th ere are no extant members of progymnosperms, but they are extremely important in plant Figure 4.20 A proposed phylogenetic placement for the earliest known tree, Pseudosprochnus .

Th ey were also a major component of Devonian-Carboniferous land- scapes ( Meyer-Berthaud et al. , 1999 ) and are found widely in fossil localities throughout the northern hemisphere. Th ey are remarkable in having a gymnosperm-like stem anatomy but reproduce by spores, similar to the ferns and lycopsids. Fossil evidence suggests that all progymnosperms were trees and many grew to up to 8 m in height with stems that reached diameters of over 1.5 m. Th ey have a fossil record that extends from mid-Devonian to early Carboniferous (~390–340 Ma). One of the fi rst fossil trees to be documented as a progymnosperm was Archaeopteris ( Beck, 1962 ; Gensel and Andrews, 1987 ) ( Figure 4.21 ). Helically arranged, deciduous branches grew out laterally from the upper part of the main trunk, on which grew laminate leaves ( Taylor and Taylor, 1993 ; Taylor et al. , 2009 ) ( Figure 4.21 b). Progymnosperm foliage is not dissimilar to the fossil fern fronds of Psaronius described in ‘Filicopsids’, and for many years these leafy branches were regarded as large pinnate fern fronds (compound leaves). It was only when fossil examples of these ‘fronds’ were found attached to trunks, with clear evi- dence of thick secondary xylem, that it became apparent that they were part of a completely diff erent evolutionary group ( Beck, 1960 ). Recent fossil fi nds in Morocco of Archaeopteris trunks have indicated that the architecture of these trees was greatly advanced and much closer in evolutionary terms to modern trees than that of the other spore-producing trees present in the early forests ( Meyer-Berthaud et al. , 1999 ). Th e stem of Archaeopteris was eustelic in structure and composed of a central pith sur- rounded by primary xylem ( Figure 4.21 c). Outside of this layer was a thick secondary xylem (up to 1 m diameter in some examples) made up of tracheids and narrow vascular rays. In some examples there is also evidence of growth rings suggesting seasonality of either pre- cipitation or temperature. Th e morphology of this wood suggests that it was dense and it bears a close similarity to the trunks of extant conifers ( Bell, 1992 ). Th e underground root system of Archaeopteris was extensive with a main axis and nu- merous lateral roots. It is presumed that the rooting system looked rather similar to that of modern conifers ( Figure 4.22 d), although it has been demonstrated that structurally they were very diff erent ( Th omas and Spicer, 1987 ; Cleal and Th omas, 2009 ). In particular, lateral roots were formed by branching of the main root axis. Archaeopteris had both fertile (with sporangia) and sterile (leafed) branches, as well as some branches that contained both sterile leaves and sporangia ( Figure 4.21 e). Th e sporan- gia were spindle-shaped and up to 3.5 mm in length ( Bell, 1992 ). Th ere is evidence in the fossil record that Archaeopteris was heterosporous with both mega and microsporangia on a fertile branch ( Taylor and Taylor, 1993 ; Taylor et al. , 2009 ), although earlier members of progymnosperms were homosporous producing only one spore size. In comparison to the other tree types in the early forests, Archaeopteris had a combination of key morphologi- cal characteristics that would have conferred a competitive advantage, including perennial lateral branches, much deeper rooting structures, and the fi rst true megaphyllous leaves. Th ese would all have enabled growth beyond the lowland swamps and probably contributed to the almost worldwide dominance of Archaeopteris trees in late Devonian fl oodplain en- vironments ( Algeo and Scheckler, 1998 ). By ~380 Ma there is evidence for monodominant forests of Archaeopteris in lowland and coastal areas over a vast geographic range ( Scott and Glasspool, 2006 ). 04-WillisandMcElwain-Chap04.indd 11604-WillisandMcElwain-Chap04.indd 116 11/28/13 2:41 PM11/28/13 2:41 PM 1174.5 EARLIEST TREES IN THE FOSSIL RECORD Evolutionary relationships: Progymnosperms and seed plants Progymnosperms are made up of two separate lineages, Aneurophytes and Archaeopteris , the latter being the closest relative of all seed plants, the spermatophytes ( Figure 4.22 ). To- gether progymnosperms and spermatophytes make up a major clade called the Lignophytes ( Pryer et al. , 2001 ; Qiu et al. , 2006 ; Doyle, 2006 ; Judd et al. , 2008 ), which are characterized by the possession of secondary xylem (wood) ( Figure 4.22 ). Archaeopteris is considered to be the sister group of spermatophytes because all species within this genus are heterospor- ous whereas Aneurophytes were all homosporous. Th e transition from homospory to het- erospory was one of the key steps involved in the evolution of the seed as discussed above. Th ere are currently 270,000 living species of seed plants but no extant members of progym- nosperms, which went extinct in the early Carboniferous ( Figure 4.23 ).

In habit this species, like others of the time, was small, herbaceous, and homosporous ( see Gensel and Andrews, 1987 ; Th omas and Spicer, 1987 ). By the Frasnian (370 Ma), however, the tree habit (arborescence) had evolved within the lycophyte lineage. One of the most common arborescent lycopsids in the fossil record was the giant Lepidodendron tree, which achieved heights of between 10 and 35 m and had a trunk up to 1 m in diameter ( Figure 4.24 a). (Th e name Lepidodendron is a generic name given to the numerous fi nds of fossil stem material that is clearly from arborescent lyco- phytes but is diffi cult to assign to one species ( Cleal and Th omas, 2009 )). Th e upper part of the trunk was branched many times to form a dense crown covered in simple micro- phyll leaves that grew directly out from the stem (i.e. without a petiole), leaving the swollen photosynthetic leaf base or ‘leaf cushion’ when shed. Leaves of Lepidodendron trees were up to 1 m in length, triangular in cross-section, and arranged in regular spirals ( Bell, 1992 ) ( Figure 4.24 b). Th e area of attachment of the leaf to the branch/trunk (the leaf base) re- mained when the leaf dropped off , resulting in a diamond-shape pattern. Fossil Lepido- dendron bark indicates this distinctive pattern ( Figure 4.25 ) and its abundance in the fossil record suggests that layers of Lepidodendron bark were regularly shed from the trees ( Cleal and Th omas, 2005 ). A distinctive feature of the fossilized bark is three dot-like impressions, which is the area where the vascular bundle and two channels of parenchyma tissue entered the leaf from the cortex ( Figure 4.24 d) ( Taylor et al. , 2009 ). Th e stem of Lepidodendron consisted of either a protostele or a siphonostele surrounded by zones of xylem and sometimes a thin layer of wood (secondary xylem) ( Figure 4.24 c). However, the main tissue contributing to trunk diameter and providing support was exten- sive layers of bark (periderm) ( Eggert, 1961 ; Gensel and Andrews, 1987 ). Th e thick bark that is resinous in appearance is considered to have been highly resistant to decay as an adapta- tion to habitats prone to frequent fl ooding ( Phillips and DiMichele, 1992 ). Lepidodendron trees are estimated to have been fast growing and to have reached full mature height within as little as 10 years ( Phillips and DiMichele, 1992 ), with bark tissue in lycopsids growing at about twice the rate of low density secondary wood observed in many tropical angiosperm trees ( Cleal and Th omas, 2005 ). Th e rooting system of the Lepidodendron tree was in many ways as impressive as the above-ground part of the plant ( Figure 4.24 e). It consisted of four or more radiating arms (axes) that were extensively branched and, although not deeply penetrating into the sub- strate, extended up to 12 m in length ( Bell, 1992 ; Taylor and Taylor, 1993 ; Taylor et al. , 2009 ). Although these rooting systems had many morphological features similar in ap- pearance to extant roots they were anatomically distinct and an intermediate morphology between roots and stems ( Cleal and Th omas, 2009 ). Th ese axes, referred to as stigmaria, were composed of large amounts of secondary xylem and cortical tissues, and bore spirally arranged lateral appendages, which were, in eff ect, the roots ( Figure 4.24 e). Th ese ‘roots’ became abscised from the older axes, leaving a circular scar ( Th omas and Spicer, 1987 ). Th e root-like appendages were fi lled with air canals, possessed no root hairs or a root cap, but were protected at the tip by a parenchymous plug ( Phillips and DiMichele, 1992 ). Th e function of stigmaria was likely similar to modern day pneumatophores, found in taxa such as swamp cypress, which serve to increase aeration in highly anaerobic and waterlogged 04-WillisandMcElwain-Chap04.indd 11904-WillisandMcElwain-Chap04.indd 119 11/28/13 2:41 PM11/28/13 2:41 PM 120 4 THE FIRST FORESTS Figure 4.24 Lepidodendron tree: (a) habit; (b) bark pattern with leaves; (c) cross section of stem with cortical tissue; (d) details of leaf scar; (e) reconstruction of stigmaria rooting system showing starburst pattern of appendages growing from root system (rhizomorph).

Th ey may have also played an important photosynthetic role by recapturing root respired CO 2 in order to minimize the loss occurring due to high rates of photorespiration in the unusually high O 2 atmospheres of the Carboniferous ( Phillips and DiMichele, 1992 ; Green, 2010 ). Lepidodendron was heterosporous and the sporophylls were clustered together in cones borne on the ends of the branches. Th ese cones were composed of a central axis with heli- cally arranged sporophylls ( Taylor and Taylor, 1993 ; Cleal and Th omas, 2009 ) and were be- tween 1 and 3.5 cm in width and 5 and 40 cm in length. From these cones the megaspores and microspores were shed. Th e fossil record thus provides evidence for many independent origins of heterospory from a homosporous ancestor, as this transition is observed in pro- gymnosperms and lycophytes. Following their evolutionary radiation, arborescent lycopsids greatly increased in num- ber to become a dominant component of the world fl ora. Th ey formed a signifi cant part of the organic material deposited in the coal measures of the late Carboniferous (~315–299 Ma), leading to estimates that they accounted for over two-thirds of the earliest tropical wetland forests ( Phillips and DiMichele, 1992 ). However, lycopsids were not exclusively trees; nu- merous herbaceous and shrubby forms have also been recognized in fossil fi nds (for detailed descriptions see Taylor et al. , 2009 and references therein). Extant lycopsids include a number of genera, including Lycopodium (club-moss) ( Figure 4.26 ), Selaginella , and Isoetes , the latter two of which are heterosporous. All three are herbaceous plants with microphyllous leaves, ranging from small epiphytes to large climb- ing plants ( Bell, 1992 ). However, no extant members of this group are arborescent.

Th e lycophytes diverged from euphyllophytes (e.g. ferns, progymno- sperms, and seed plants), which have predominantly megaphyll leaf development, in the early Devonian ( Figure 3.23 ). Within lycophytes there are both homosporous and heterosporous lineages but only the extinct Lepidodendrales and extant Isoetales have the potential to pro- duce secondary growth. Th e lycophyte lineage split early on in evolutionary terms to form two major clades, the zosterophyllophytes (zosterophytes), which bore lateral sporangia di- rect on their leafl ess stems, and the lycopsids, which have microphyll leaves, with sporangia in their axils. In evolutionary terms these two clades had very diff erent fates as follows: 1. Th e zosterophytes include only extinct members (e.g. Zosterophyllum , Figure 3.17 ) and no further evolution of this clade is thought to have occurred beyond the Devonian (~360 Ma). 2. Th e lycophytes, in comparison, include both extinct and extant members and provide a phylogenetic link between the earliest vascular plants, such as Zosterophyllum , and extant families such as Lycopodiaceae and Selaginellaceae ( Table 4.1 ) ( Kenrick and Crane, 1997a , b ). Today there are ~1200 species of lycophytes including the homosporous genera Huperzia and Lycopodium (club mosses), and Selaginella (spike mosses), which are heterosporous, with the microspores developing into the male gametophyte and the megaspores developing into the female gametophyte ( Judd et al. , 2008 ).

Many fossil species of sphenopsids have been identifi ed from the Carboniferous and Per- mian (~358–252 Ma) ( Taylor et al. , 2009 ; Cleal and Th omas, 2009 ), including several forms that evolved a tree habit. Th e largest of these was the giant horsetail tree, Calamites . Th ese trees grew up to 18 m in height and had a creeping rhizome from which massive aerial stems arose, bearing whorls of branches and leaves ( Figure 4.28 a). Th e leaves of the Calamites tree had a single vein running down the middle of the leaf. Two types of leaves have been identifi ed in the fossil record: needle-like leaves borne in whorls of 4–40 and up to 3.0 mm long, and lanceolate leaves up to 8.0 mm long, which were borne in clusters of 5–32 ( Figure 4.28 b). Calamites stems were horizontally dissected into many nodes from which branches and whorls of leaves sprouted ( Figure 4.28 a). Th e upper branches also bore whorls of leaves ( Figure 4.28 b). In structure the stem was a siphonostele with a central pith. Th is was Figure 4.27 Model of extant horsetail (Equisetum), indicating its distinctive morphology. © The Field Museum, Chicago. # B83077c. 04-WillisandMcElwain-Chap04.indd 12504-WillisandMcElwain-Chap04.indd 125 11/28/13 2:41 PM11/28/13 2:41 PM 126 4 THE FIRST FORESTS surrounded by vascular bundles of primary phloem and xylem, which were then surrounded by secondary xylem ( Figure 4.28 c). Fossil evidence suggests that in many examples this sec- ondary thickening was at least 12 cm thick ( Taylor and Taylor, 1993 ; Taylor et al. , 2009 ). Calamites possessed a complex root system composed of large underground rhizomes, which were segmented, and from which arose the aerial stems, root branches, and root hairs ( Bockelie, 1994 ) ( Figure 4.19 d). Some Calamites were homosporous but there is strong evidence for heterospory in late Carboniferous Calamites ( Stewart and Rothwell, 1993 ), providing yet another example of the evolutionary trend from homospory to heterospory. Similar to Lepidodendron trees, the spore-bearing structures were aggregated into cones. Location of the cones varied greatly, with evidence suggesting single cones, clusters at nodes, or several cones on fertile appendages at the end of lateral branches ( Figure 4.28 e). Th e Figure 4.28 Calamites tree: (a) habit; (b) leaves; (c) stem and cross section of stem; (d) roots; (e) reproductive structures.

Th e life cycle of the ho- mosporous Calamites is thought to have most closely resembled that of extant Equisetum . Arborescent forms of sphenopsids formed a signifi cant fraction of the organic material present in the late Carboniferous coal measures deposited between 315 and 299 Ma. Similar to lycophytes, following their radiation, arborescent forms of sphenopsids rapidly increased in number and diversity. Th ese trees fl ourished in wet, swampy conditions and their large underground rooting rhizomes would have provided an ideal base from which aerial stems could force their way through the swamp. Th ey probably did not form an understorey to the lycopsid trees, but rather grew in clearings or on the waterside edges of forests ( Th omas and Spicer, 1987 ) and probably in thickets. Fossil deposits from the Brymbo fossil forest in Wales, for example, have revealed numerous Calamites thickets similar to the growth form of extant Equisetum ( Appleton et al. , 2011 ) with spreading horizontal stems and nodes of growth branching off from them. Filicopsids (ferns) Fossil ferns have a record dating back to the early Carboniferous (~360 Ma) and many of these bear remarkable similarity to extant forms ( Taylor et al. , 2009 ). Th ere are numerous examples in the fossil record of the tree-fern Psaronius ( Figure 4.29 a), which grew up to 10 m tall and was the largest of the ferns found in the coal-measure swamps ( Th omas and Spicer, 1987 ) and is thought to be the precursor to the extant Marattiaceae family ( Taylor et al. , 2009 ). It is suggested that their gigantic form and relatively energetically cheap method of trunk construction would certainly have enabled them to exploit light effi ciently in the Lepidodendron swamp forests, where they occupied the drier areas ( Gastaldo et al. , 1996 ; DiMichele and Phillips, 2002 ). Th e leaves of Psaronius were megaphylls consisting of large, pinnately compound fronds. Some of these fronds were fertile in that they bore sporangia on the lower side of the pin- nules, similar to many extant ferns ( Th omas and Spicer, 1987 ; Cleal and Th omas, 2009 ) ( Figure 4.29 b). Th e trunk of Psaronius was unbranched and the fronds developed at the top of the main axis forming an apical crown ( Bell, 1992 ). When the leaves abscised from the trunk, they left a distinctive circular leaf scar, which is diagnostic of diff erent species. Psaronius possessed a complex stelar structure with a small protostelic stem at the base sur- rounded by an abundant mantle of roots. Th e roots of the mantle grew out as lateral append- ages from the main trunk, and then became orientated vertically downwards parallel to the main stem to act, in eff ect, as guy-ropes ( Figure 4.29 a). A similar method of trunk construc- tion is seen in Pseudosprochnus , discussed earlier in Section 4.5 . Towards the top of the trunk, the stem diameter became greater while the layer of ad- ventitious roots became proportionately narrower. Th e stem was thus composed of an inverted stelar cone surrounded by adventitious roots ( Taylor and Taylor, 1993 ). Th e con- struction of the stele was also complicated by the fact that each of the leaf bases received an extensive leaf trace consisting of several strands of vascular tissue ( Figure 4.29 d). Th is resulted in numerous concentric leaf gaps visible in cross sections of the stele ( Bell, 1992 ). Th ere was no secondary vascular tissue (wood) in the trunk. Rather, their tree-like stature 04-WillisandMcElwain-Chap04.indd 12704-WillisandMcElwain-Chap04.indd 127 11/28/13 2:41 PM11/28/13 2:41 PM 128 4 THE FIRST FORESTS was made possible by the supporting strength of adventitious roots as in all extant tree- ferns, which share the same structure. Palaeobotanical evidence suggests that in some specimens, the root mantle reached 1 m in diameter at the base of the stem ( Taylor and Taylor, 1993 ). Th e majority of extinct ferns, including Psaronius , were homosporous. In Psaronius the sporangia were large and arranged in fused clusters, called synangia, on the lower surface of the pinnules of fertile fronds. It is suggested that this arrangement probably evolved when webbing linked fertile branches to form megaphylls, incorporating the sporangia on the underside of the frond ( Figure 4.30 ). Th e life cycle of Psaronius is thought to have been similar, if not identical, to extant Marat- tiales, with the spores being released from the plant to germinate and form free-living, Figure 4.29 Psaronius tree: (a) Full habit showing attachment of large pinnately compound fronds forming an apical crown.

Psaronius are thought to have grown in poorly drained areas in seasonally dry landscapes. Although the Marattiales are given as the example group, it must also be noted that there were a number of other fi licopsid groups evolving arborescent, shrubby, and herbaceous forms during this period. In fact, up to 12 diff erent groups of ferns are recognized in the fos- sil record by the lower Permian (~298 Ma), some of which have extant relatives and others that are now extinct ( Stewart and Rothwell, 1993 ; Taylor and Taylor, 1993 ; Taylor et al. , 2009 ; Cleal and Th omas, 2009 ). Evolutionary relationships: horsetails and ferns Th e phylogenetic position of equisetophytes (horsetails) has changed markedly in the last ten years and is still not fully resolved today. Th e equisetophytes belong to a large clade called Monilophytes, which incorporates all living and extinct fi licopsids (ferns) and all liv- ing and extinct equisetophytes ( Pryer et al. , 2001 ) ( Figure 4.31 ). Th ere are approximately 12,170 species of Monilophytes living today belonging to fi ve major lineages of uncertain evolutionary position in relation to each other ( Pryer et al. , 2004 ; Smith et al. , 2006 ; Rothwell and Nixon, 2006 ; Judd et al. , 2008 ). Monilophytes together with Lignophytes ( Figure 4.22 ; progymnosperms and spermatophytes) make up the Euphyllophyte clade ( Figure 4.31 ). Eq- uisetophytes are notable in not having true megaphyll leaves, as morphologically their leaves are more similar to microphylls. However, similarities in chloroplast and nuclear DNA se- quence data fi rmly place equisetophytes with ferns rather than with lycophytes (described previously), which have microphyll leaves ( Pryer et al. , 2001 ). Earliest seed-producing trees Along with the spore-producing giant horsetails, lycopsids, fi licopsids, and progymno- sperms, two groups of early seed plants, namely the pteridosperms and cordaites, were pre- sent in the forests of the early and late Carboniferous (~360–299 Ma).

Th ere is fossil evidence for at least six families of seed ferns during the Carbon- iferous and Permian (~358–250 Ma) ( Table 4.1 ) with the earliest seed fern fossil ( Elkinsia polymorpha ) dating back to the Famenian (~372 Ma) ( Rothwell and Scheckler, 1988 ). Some had a prostrate vine-like habit, but most were arborescent forms and similar in gen- eral appearance to modern tree-ferns ( Stewart and Rothwell, 1993 ). Th e largest seed ferns in the fossil record were in the Medullosaceae family and included arborescent forms up to 10 m in height. One of the predominant genera in this family was Medullosa noei ( Figure 4.32 ). Th e fossil records suggest that these were abundant in Carboniferous fl ood- plains (>290 Ma) and extend well into the Permian forests (>250 Ma) ( DiMichele et al. , 2006 ; Linkies et al. , 2010 ). Th e leaves of Medullosa were large megaphyllous fronds, pin- nately divided and dichotomously branched ( Figure 4.32 b). Th ey were usually spirally arranged on the stem and had petioles up to 20 cm in diameter. Individual pinnules were usually approximately 2–4 cm in length and had a distinctive venation pattern, oft en with a prominent mid-vein and secondary veins at angles from this ( Taylor and Taylor, 1993 ; Taylor et al. , 2009 ). Medullosa trees (e.g. Medullosa noei ) grew to up to 10 m in height and had a wide-based stem with diameters of up to 0.5 m. Th ey had a complex stelar structure composed of a single stele divided into many vascular segments ( Figure 4.32 c). Each vascular segment was made up of a central core of primary xylem and parenchyma cells surrounded by a cylinder of secondary xylem (wood). Th e secondary xylem contained very large tracheids, similar in Figure 4.31 Simpliﬁ ed evolutionary tree of vascular plants (tracheophytes) illustrating a split between the Lycophyte and Euphyllophyte lineages. Simpliﬁ ed from Judd et al. ( 2008 ) based on studies by Pryer et al. ( 2001 , 2004 ); Qiu et al. ( 2006 ) . Monilophytes (ferns & Equisetophytes) Lignophytes (progymnosperms & seed plants) Euphyllophytes Vascular plants (Tracheophytes) Lycophytes 04-WillisandMcElwain-Chap04.indd 13004-WillisandMcElwain-Chap04.indd 130 11/28/13 2:41 PM11/28/13 2:41 PM 1314.5 EARLIEST TREES IN THE FOSSIL RECORD size and function to those seen in early angiosperms ( Wilson and Knoll, 2010 ). Th is second- ary xylem was rather unusual in that it was thickest towards the centre of the stem ( Th omas and Spicer, 1987 ) suggesting that the secondary xylem was formed towards the inside of the primary xylem, unlike the situation in living plants. Surrounding the secondary xylem was the vascular cambium, secondary phloem, and cortical tissues. Th e very large tracheid size of Medullosan pteridosperms is a particularly interesting trait since it would have facilitated Figure 4.32 Medullosa noei tree: (a) habit; (b) leaves; (c) stem and stelar structure; (d) ovules; (e) pollen organ; (f) monolete pre-pollen (up to 600 μm in diameter).

Th e drawback of such an adaptation, however, is that Medullosa would have been unable to withstand drought or freezing to the same degree as co-occurring plant taxa with smaller tracheids (e.g. cordaites or conifers); modern physi- ological studies have shown that the likelihood of air bubbles forming in xylem increases with tracheid dimensions. Once an air bubble (embolism) has formed it can cut off water supply to large parts of the plant body. On the external part of the stem, the lower portion was covered with adventitious roots ( Figure 4.32 a), whereas higher up there were spirally arranged leaf bases ( Stewart and Rothwell, 1993 ). Th e adventitious roots, together with a single stele that became divided at intervals along the trunk, provided support. Fossil evidence suggests that these roots could be up to 2.5 cm in diameter and were abundant, with secondary tissues. Medullosa ovules/seeds are common in the fossil record, and at least 14 morphologically distinctive seed morphologies have been recognized ( Linkies et al. , 2010 ). Th ey range in size between 1 and 11 cm and have a three-layered enclosed integument with a micropyle and simple pollen chamber ( Figure 4.32 d). Th ese seeds share a close morphological similarity to cycad seeds, supporting the suggestion that the two are closely related ( see Chapter 5 ). However, very few fossil Medullosa ovule specimens have been found attached to the fronds, and as such their phylogenetic position remains somewhat uncertain ( Cleal and Th omas, 1999 , 2009 ). Th e pre-pollen grains of Medullosa trees were located in pollen organs borne on fertile branches in clusters, or in place of the pinnae. Th ese were large structures (2–3 cm in di- ameter) probably resulting from numerous fused sporangia ( Taylor and Taylor, 1993 ) ( Figure 4.32 e), containing monolete pollen grains (with a single furrow) between 100 and 600 μm in length ( Figure 4.32 f). As discussed in Section 4.4 the pre-pollen grains of Medul- losa did not deliver sperm directly to the archegonia of the ovule but instead ruptured to release motile sperm into the pollen chamber ( Figure 4.16 ). Fossilized sperm found within Medullosa pollen chambers confi rm this fertilization strategy ( Poort et al ., 1996 ). Evolutionary relationships: seed ferns and seed plants Th e term ‘pteridosperms’ has a long history of use in palaeobotany to describe all fossil taxa with fern-like leaves that reproduce by seeds. Th is combination of morphological traits appears to have evolved multiple independent times in plant evolutionary history. Pteri- dosperms are grouped within the seed plants (spermatophytes) together with all living and extinct plant taxa that have the seed habit; however, their phylogenetic position within sper- matophytes is far from resolved ( Hilton and Bateman, 2006 ). Morphological phylogenies usually indicate that cycads are most closely related to seed ferns; however, this is not always the case. Irrespective of the relative topology of the spermatophyte tree, what is certain is that seed ferns are Lignophytes (along with the progymnosperms described earlier in the section) since they have secondary xylem and along with the Monilophytes make up the Euphyllophyte clade (having megaphyll leaves) ( Figure 4.31 ). Th ey are arguably the most important group in terms of angiosperm evolution as it is likely that all living (~250,000) angiosperms have an ancestry in the seed fern lineage rather than any known living gym- nosperm ( Hilton and Bateman, 2006 ). Th ese evolutionary relationships will be discussed in more detail in Chapters 5 and 6 . 04-WillisandMcElwain-Chap04.indd 13204-WillisandMcElwain-Chap04.indd 132 11/28/13 2:41 PM11/28/13 2:41 PM 1334.5 EARLIEST TREES IN THE FOSSIL RECORD Cordaites Cordaites are an extinct group of gymnosperms. Fossil evidence for cordaites suggests that they were present from the late Carboniferous to the Permian (~350–250 Ma) ( Taylor et al. , 2009 ) although there is some discussion as to whether unattributed, but substantial, woody remains dating as far back as 380 million years ago may also be associated with this group ( Bell, 1992 ). All evidence obtained so far suggests that the cordaites were predominantly ar- borescent (trees and shrubs) and occupied a range of diff erent habitats from mangrove-type habitats to drier uplands ( Cleal and Th omas, 2009 ). With fossil trunks measuring up to 30 m in height and 1 m in diameter, these plants may have represented some of the tallest trees in the late Carboniferous and Permian forests ( Figure 4.33 ). Trees in the cordaites group all had a main stem with single branches radiating out towards the top of the axis ( Figure 4.33 a). In cross section the trunk was composed of large amounts of secondary xylem surround- ing a medullated primary stele ( Figure 4.33 b). Cordaitean leaves were variable but usually helically arranged on long, slender branches. Many species in the fossil record bear a close morphological similarity to leaves of the extant genus Agathis (Araucariaceae). Th e leaves themselves were strap-shaped or tongue-shaped. Th e tip of the leaf was bluntly rounded with a broad leaf base attaching it to the branch ( Figure 4.33 f). Most leaves were morpho- logically distinctive, with long parallel veins but no central vein (midrib) running down its length ( Taylor and Taylor, 1993 ). However, some cordaitean leaves were more needle-like in appearance, with only a single vein running down each leaf ( Stewart and Rothwell, 1993 ). Th eir pollen was monosaccate (a single sac) and non-motile sperm were directly delivered to the archegonia in the ovule via a pollen tube ( Figure 4.17 c), similar to that seen in mod- ern conifers ( Poort et al. , 1996 ). Th ey are thus one of the earliest groups in the fossil record to evolve a siphonogamous pollination strategy. Despite similarities in pollination strategy among ancient cordaites and more derived conifers, cordaites are thought to have diverged very early from the conifer lineage ( Gomankov, 2009 ). Rooting systems of the cordaites were variable in structure. Fossil evidence suggests that some groups had extensive rooting systems, with lateral roots radiating from large branched primary roots ( Bockelie, 1994 ), whereas others consisted of lateral roots forming in clusters on only one side of the main root. Th is latter type is typical of extant plants that grow in mangrove swamps and possibly indicates the environmental conditions in which these trees grew ( Th omas and Spicer, 1987 ). Reproductive structures were borne on the same branches as the leaves. Male and female organs were separate but probably located on the same tree ( Bell, 1992 ) ( Figure 4.33 d). Th e male organs were located on shoots up to 1 cm long that contained a number of scales ar- ranged around the shoot axis in a spiral, forming a structure similar to a conifer cone. Th e lower scales were sterile but the upper scales terminated in cylindrical pollen sacs (up to 1 mm in length), which contained numerous monosaccate pollen grains, each between 45 and 65 μm in diameter ( Figure 4.33 e). Th e female reproductive organs were also located on the branches and bore some similar- ity to the male organs in that they were cone-shaped and composed of fertile and infertile scales. However, in the female organs, the fertile scales terminated in ovules rather than pol- len sacs ( Bell, 1992 ). Each seed was surrounded by three integumentary layers, forming an enclosed seed coat with micropyle. Th e margin of the seed extended as a wing (platyspermic). 04-WillisandMcElwain-Chap04.indd 13304-WillisandMcElwain-Chap04.indd 133 11/28/13 2:41 PM11/28/13 2:41 PM 134 4 THE FIRST FORESTS Figure 4.33 Cordaitales tree: (a) habit; (b) stem and stelar structure; (c) branch with leaves and reproductive shoots; (d) reproductive structures; (e) pollen (45–65 μm in diameter); (f) leaf.

Th ey are Euphyllophytes as they predominantly possess true megaphylll leaves (however, there are exceptions to this for some species) and they are spermatophytes as they have a seed habit. However, their phylogenetic position within spermatophytes is still far from resolved ( Doyle and Donoghue, 1986 ; Hilton and Bateman, 2006 ; Judd et al. , 2008 ). Detailed analysis of the evolution of pollen and ovulate cone morphology indi- cates that conifers and cordaites diverged from each other some time in the Carboniferous ( Rothwell et al. , 2005 ; Gomankov, 2009 ). Further analysis of additional morphological traits is required to resolve their phylogenetic position in relation to both living and extinct seed plant groups. One of many suggested evolutionary hypotheses is that the cordaite lineage branched off early from a large clade containing all living and extinct conifers, Gnetales, and ginkgos ( Doyle, 2006 ), three important groups of spermatophytes that will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 5 . 4.6 Biogeographical distribution of global vegetation during the early (~359–342 Ma) and late Carboniferous (~318–299 Ma) Th e ecology, structure, and diversity of some of the earliest forests of the middle to late Devonian (395–360 Ma) are well defi ned ( Scheckler, 1985 , 1986 ). However, it is not until the early Carboniferous that there are enough fossil fl oras to get a detailed global picture of plant distribution and biogeography ( Rowley et al. , 1985 ; Wnuk, 1996 ). Th e aim of the next section and throughout the book is to provide a general overview of the major biogeographi- cal regions or ‘biomes’ and how they have changed in composition and spatial structure through time. First, however, plant biogeographical concepts and classifi cation schemes are reviewed briefl y, in order to outline some of the general limitations associated with global biogeographical analysis, and the extrapolation of modern biogeographical systems, such as the ‘biome’ concept, to the fossil record. Plant biogeographical concepts and classiﬁ cation scheme Plant biogeography has played an extremely important role in the reconstruction of con- tinental positions in the past, particularly at times of high fl oral provincialism (e.g. during the Carboniferous). Many methods have been used to divide up global vegetation into rec- ognizable units. Th ese include taxonomic and/or ecological characteristics and measures of plant diversity ( Table 4.2 ). Similarly, many classifi cation schemes have been employed to defi ne these plant biogeographical units and this has led to a long, and oft en confusing, nomenclature. All of the various methods employed are limited by the incompleteness of the fossil re- cord. In addition, the eff ect of diff ering preservation (taphonomy) and the fact that whole plants are rarely preserved, leading to the counting of the individual organs as separate spe- cies (which can result in overestimation of fossil plant diversity), can lead to diffi culties in extrapolation of widely spaced fl oras ( Scott and Galtier, 1996 ). Keeping these limitations in 04-WillisandMcElwain-Chap04.indd 13504-WillisandMcElwain-Chap04.indd 135 11/28/13 2:41 PM11/28/13 2:41 PM 136 4 THE FIRST FORESTS mind, however, the use of ‘climatically sensitive’ sediments (e.g. coals, salt deposits) in addi- tion to taxonomic, ecological, and diversity patterns in global vegetation have added greatly to our understanding of the delineation of fossil plant biomes and how they have changed spatially through time ( Ziegler, 1990 ; Rees et al. , 2000 ). For instance, the presence of evapo- rites, which occur in environments where net evaporation exceeds net precipitation, helps to delimit the extent of past deserts ( Parrish, 1998 ). All of the biogeographical maps presented throughout this book have been standardized using the biome scheme of Ziegler ( Ziegler, 1990 ; Table 4.3 ). Th ey incorporate both fossil plant and lithological data in the delimitation of the fossil biomes, which have been defi ned accord- ing to our understanding of the climatic, edaphic, and plant physiognomic features that char- acterize the ten major biomes recognized in our world vegetation today, as laid out in Table 4.3 . Biogeographical distribution of global vegetation 359–345 Ma (early Carboniferous) Five distinct biomes are recognized for the early Carboniferous (359 to 345 Ma) using the biome scheme of Ziegler ( 1990 ; Table 4.3 ), on the basis of detailed analyses of fossil fl oras ( Rowley et al. 1985 ; Cleal and Th omas, 1991 , 1999 ; Wnuk, 1996 and references therein) and from evidence of climatically sensitive sediments for this time (PaleoAtlas project, http:// www.geo.arizona.edu/~rees/PGAPhome.html ) ( Figure 4.34 ). Tropical everwet biome Th e tropical everwet biome encompassed a narrow equatorial belt including present-day China, Scandinavia, and parts of Greenland and North America. It was characterized by fos- sil fl oras composed of arborescent lycopsids (e.g. Lepidodendron and Stigmaria ), sphenopsids Table 4.2 Plant biogeographical classiﬁ cation schemes (from Wnuk, 1996 ).

Th e South China region had a similar ‘broad equatorial’ fl ora dominated by lycopsids with some sphenopsids and ferns, although endemic form-genera that made this region distinctive were also present. Th is biome is defi ned by others as the North Laurussian region (reviewed by Wnuk, 1996 ). Th e presence of abundant coals, which are indicative of wet or everwet climates, and a low palaeolatitude support the assignment of this region to the tropical everwet biome. Th ere is good fossil evidence supporting the suggestion that onset of glaciation on Gondwana coin- cides with the appearance of lycopsid dominated forests throughout the tropical latitudes ( Cleal and Th omas, 2005 ). Summerwet (tropical) biome A seasonally wet or summerwet biome encompassed the remainder of Euramerica from palaeolatitude 5–30°, and Kazakhstan. Th e vegetation of the swamp environments was com- posed predominantly of arborescent lycopsids and pteridosperms, whereas sphenopsids were less abundant than in the tropical everwet biome. Th e assignment of a summerwet biome to these areas is supported by evidence from palaeoecology for a seasonally wet cli- mate ( Knaus et al. , 2000 ; Falcon-Lang, 1999 ). Tropical desert belts, indicated by the presence of evaporites (Ziegler and Rees, personal communication), help to defi ne the southerly limit of the summerwet biome. Th e southern hemisphere portion of this biome is defi ned by oth- ers as the Acadian–Laurussian region ( Raymond, 1985 ; Wnuk, 1996 ). Kazakhstan, which was a separate continent ( Figure 4.1 ), was characterized by a fl ora com- posed of approximately 45 per cent endemic form-genera ( Raymond, 1985 ; Cleal and Th omas, 1991 ), including species of lycopsids and seed ferns ( Meyen, 1987 ). Although Wnuk ( 1996 ) at- tributes a warm temperate climate to the Kazakhstan region during this interval, the presence of evaporites, the general short stature of the vegetation, and lack of the rhizophorous rooting structures known as stigmaria indicate that this fl ora was also part of the seasonally wet biome.

Fossil fl oras are absent from this biome. Warm temperate biome Th e higher palaeolatitudes between 30–70° make up the warm temperate biome. In Siberia the fl oras were dominated by small lycopsid trees, distinguishable by a shorter stature than those of the tropical everwet biome, and sphenopsids. Fewer pteridosperms were present compared to the tropical everwet and summerwet biomes. Th is biome in the northern hemi- sphere is referred to by others as the Angaran region (Siberia and Kazakhstan) (reviewed by Wnuk, 1996 ). In the southern hemisphere, classifi ed as the Gondwanan region, the vegeta- tion was dominated by arborescent lycopsids, sphenopsids, and early seed ferns. Although the composition of the vegetation was very similar to that of the lower latitude biomes, the diversity was considerably lower. Furthermore, the lycopsids of the Gondwanan region possessed similar morphological characteristics to those in the warm temperate biome of the northern hemisphere, in that they were shorter in stature and lacked stigmaria-type rooting structures, indicating cooler temperatures. Th e morphological similarities of these high-latitude fl oras, together with their lower general diversity than those of the equatorial biome and the presence of coals, are indicative of warm, wet climates typical of the warm temperate biome. Cool–cold temperate, arctic, and glacial biomes A gradation of climatic conditions and also biomes most likely existed between the warm temperature biome covering most of Gondwana and the glacial biome (ice sheet) to the south. However, as no fossil fl oras of early Carboniferous age are known south of 60° it is not possible, as yet, to indicate the limits of these biomes with confi dence, or to docu- ment the composition of the vegetation that was present. Th e northerly limits of the glacial biome are based on the presence of glacial deposits (tillites) and glacial pavement studies ( see Figure 4.2 ). However, the picture of glacial-interglacial changes throughout the entire Carboniferous and early Permian is now believed to have been much more dynamic than previously understood with multiple ice sheets developing asynchronously and from diff er- ent ice centres ( Fielding et al. , 2008 ; Fielding, 2010 ; Isbell et al. , 2012 ; Montañez and Poulsen, 2013 ). Th e early Carboniferous is characterized by onset of initially short-lived high latitude glaciation in the Tournaisian (~350 Ma) leading to well established glaciation by the mid Visean (~330 Ma) (reviewed in Montañez and Poulsen, 2013 ). Biogeographical distribution of global vegetation 318–299 Ma (late Carboniferous) By late Carboniferous time (Pennsylvanian: 318–299 Ma), six to eight biomes are recognized based on the same criteria as those used for the early Carboniferous ( Figure 4.35 ) and on 04-WillisandMcElwain-Chap04.indd 14004-WillisandMcElwain-Chap04.indd 140 11/28/13 2:41 PM11/28/13 2:41 PM 1414.6 BIOGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF GLOBAL VEGETATION biogeographical studies by Rowley et al. ( 1985 ) , Ziegler et al. ( 1981 ) , Cleal and Th omas ( 1991 ) , and Wnuk ( 1996 ) . Tropical everwet biome Th e tropical everwet biome encompassed present-day eastern North America, western Europe, China, and north Africa. Th e vegetation of this biome was dominated by forests composed of pteridosperms, lycopsids, and tree-ferns (fi licopsids), as well as other early seed plants such as cordaites. Lycopsid diversity and abundance in all of these low-latitude forests was greatly diminished (with the exception of those in the western Appalachian re- gion of North America) compared to the dominant position they held in nearly all of the major biomes during the early Carboniferous. Summerwet (tropical) biome Th e summerwet biome contained a higher proportion of more drought-resistant conifers, such as Lebachia and Ernestiodendron , with more reduced leaves compared to those of the tropical everwet biome. Sphenopsids such as Phylotheca were also present. Th is biome covered a narrow band immediately to the north and south of the tropical everwet biome ( Figure 4.35 ). Cúneo ( 1989 ) suggests that fl oral diff erentiation was also apparent on the western coast of South America, with a distinctive subtropical fl ora in what is now western Argentina at this time. Subtropical desert biome Th e frequent occurrence of evaporites (Ziegler, personal communication) and almost com- plete absence of fossil plants characterized this biome. It spanned an area including most of Greenland and Scandinavia and northern Canada in the northern hemisphere, and parts of Brazil and western Africa in the southern hemisphere. Warm temperate biome By the late Carboniferous (~300 Ma) Kazakhstan had collided with Siberia ( see Section 4.1 ), thereby increasing the aerial extent of the warm temperate biome (part of the Angaran bioge- ographical realm) in the northern hemisphere ( Figure 4.35 ). Th is biome spanned the entire area of present-day Kazakhstan and south-eastern Siberia (also known as the sub-Angaran realm) in the northern hemisphere and the north coastal fringes of Gondwana in the south- ern hemisphere. Fossil fl oras of this biome were abundant, of high diversity, and well mixed. Th ey were dominated by sphenopsids (including Calamites ), pteridosperms, and cordaites ( Meyen, 1982 ; Cleal and Th omas, 1991 ). Cool to cold temperate and Arctic biomes Th e cool/cold temperate biome in both hemispheres covered present-day north-eastern Siberia in the northern hemisphere and the entire Gondwana supercontinent with the 04-WillisandMcElwain-Chap04.indd 14104-WillisandMcElwain-Chap04.indd 141 11/28/13 2:41 PM11/28/13 2:41 PM 142 4 THE FIRST FORESTS exception of the coastal regions and those covered by ice. It was characterized by signifi - cantly lower species diversity than that found in the warm temperate biome ( Retallack, 1980 ; Meyen, 1987 ; Durante, 1995 ). Th e dominant vegetation included pteridosperms, cordaites, and signifi cantly fewer sphenopsids. In comparison to the wide diversity of taxa present in the warm temperate biome, veg- etation became increasingly open, particularly in the southern hemisphere ( Figure 4.35 ) and dominated by shrubby and herbaceous forms of lycopsids, sphenopsids, and the pteridosperm, Botrychiopsis ( Archangelsky and Cúneo, 1990 ; Wnuk, 1996 ). Th e distinctly ‘primitive’ nature of the cold temperate fl oras of the southern hemisphere, compared with those of the tropical everwet and warm temperate biomes, has meant they have been in- terpreted by Retallack ( 1980 ) as ‘tundra’-type vegetation. It is possible, therefore, that an arctic biome existed between the cold temperate and glacial biomes, in areas close to ice sheets. Th e assignment of these regions to the cool/cold temperate biomes is supported by the presence of both tillites and coals, which, when found in association, indicate cool temperate conditions. Glacial or polar desert biome? Glacial history was perhaps at its most dynamic in the mid to late Carboniferous ( Isbell et al. , 2012 ; Montañez and Poulsen, 2013 ). Peak glaciation occurred from the latest Serpukho- vian (~320 Ma) through the fi rst half of the Moscovian (~308 Ma) ( Montañez and Poulsen, 2013 ). Th is was followed by a long-term trend of global warming ( Montañez et al. , 2007 ) and aridifi cation of climate, particularly in the southern hemisphere ( Isbell et al. , 2012 ; González and Díaz Saravia, 2010 ). Th e absence of clearly indicative glacial deposits in Antarctica in the late Carboniferous has led to the revised characterization of the most southerly latitude biome as polar desert rather than glacial as once believed ( Isbell et al. , 2012 ).

In the tropical everwet biome, for instance, the lycopsid and sphenopsid composition of wetland swamps declined and was replaced by fern dominated vegetation ( Cross and Phillips, 1990 ; Phillips et al. , 1985 ; DiMichele et al. , 2001 ; Hilton and Cleal, 2007 ; Pfeff erkorn et al. , 2008 ). In the tropical summerwet biome there was a coeval rise in the sporadic appearance of conifers and other major seed plant groups adapted to seasonally drier climate ( DiMichele et al. 1992 ). Furthermore, the geographical extent of the subtropical desert biome expanded and polar deserts appeared for the fi rst time. Plant diversity increased in the temperate biome of Angara and Gondwana ( Cleal and Th omas, 2005 ) suggesting that the centre of high produc- tivity shift ed from low to higher latitudes, perhaps because of higher global temperatures. All of these changes are thought to refl ect a general aridifi cation of late Carboniferous cli- mates. Against this climatic backdrop, major new groups of seed plants radiated, which will be the focus of Chapter 5 . Summary 1. During the period spanning the early Devonian to late Carboniferous (394–299 Ma), global vegetation evolved from one dominated by small, weedy plants, most less than 1 m in height, to fully forested ecosystems with trees towering up to 35 m. 2. Global climates during this time can be divided into two distinct intervals. Th e fi rst, span- ning the period 394–360 Ma, had warm, humid climates with high levels of atmospheric CO 2 . From 360 Ma onwards, global climates became increasingly cool and arid, with evi- dence for extensive periods of glaciation occurring between 360 and 299 Ma. Th ere was also enhanced precipitation in a narrow equatorial belt, up to a 90 per cent drop in atmos- pheric CO 2 , and increasing levels of atmospheric O 2 . 3. Th e transformation in global climates from ~360 Ma was due to a number of factors, in- cluding the position of the South Pole in relation to the Gondwana landmass, mountain building episodes, and changes in atmospheric concentrations associated with coloniza- tion of the land by plants. 4. Further adaptations to land dwelling that became apparent between 394 and 360 Ma included a more advanced vascular system, additional supporting mechanisms (roots, wood, bark), and leaves. 5. Th e earliest arborescent forms of plants (trees) appeared in the middle Devonian (~385 Ma). 6. Fossil evidence suggests that the plant life cycle also became more refi ned from ~400 Ma onwards with the evolution of sporangia producing two spore sizes (megaspores and microspores), and the evolution of ovules with seed coats (seeds), pollen grains, and pollen reception mechanisms. 04-WillisandMcElwain-Chap04.indd 14404-WillisandMcElwain-Chap04.indd 144 11/28/13 2:41 PM11/28/13 2:41 PM 145SUMMARY 7. By the early Carboniferous (360 Ma) evolution and expansion of four major groups of spore-producing plants, namely the sphenopsids (Equisitales: horsetails), lycop- sids (club mosses), fi licopsids (ferns), and progymnosperms, and two groups of seed- producing plants (cordaites and pteridosperms), had occurred. Forests composed of these groups had widespread global distribution. 8. Broad-scale biogeographic reconstruction for the early Carboniferous (359–342 Ma) indicates that fi ve biomes are recognizable: tropical everwet, tropical summerwet, sub- tropical desert, warm temperate, and cool temperate/arctic/glacial biomes. 9. A slightly later biogeographic reconstruction (~318–299 Ma) indicates that provinciality of the global vegetation increased markedly through the Carboniferous, and that by this time at least six and possibly eight biomes can be recognized: tropical everwet, tropical summerwet, subtropical desert, warm temperate, cool to cold temperate, arctic and gla- cial, probably refl ecting the general aridifi cation of the late Carboniferous climates. 04-WillisandMcElwain-Chap04.indd 14504-WillisandMcElwain-Chap04.indd 145 11/28/13 2:41 PM11/28/13 2:41 PM 5 Major emergence of the seed plants Evidence from the plant fossil record suggests that two groups of seed plants, the Cordaitales and pteridosperms, were established by the middle Carboniferous (~350 Ma) ( see Chapter 4 ). However, it was not until the Permian, some 70 to 80 million years later, that seed plants be- came dominant in the world fl ora. Th is major fl oral transition involved not only the expan- sion of these two early seed plant groups but also the emergence of new groups including the Cycadales (cycads), Ginkgoales (ginkgos), Bennettitales (bennettites), Glossopteridaceae (glossopterids), and Gnetales. By the upper Permian (~260 Ma) over 60 per cent of the global fl ora was composed of gymnosperms and the arborescent lycopsids and sphenopsids, which had dominated early Carboniferous fl oras, were in decline ( Figure 5.1 ). Th is chapter outlines the emergence and radiation of the seed plants and the environmental and climatic conditions that existed prior to and during their radiation. 5.1 Environmental changes during the Permian (299–252 Ma) A series of continental collisions that occurred since the Carboniferous ( see Chapter 4 ) fi nally culminated in the joining of Laurasia with Gondwana, Laurasia with Kazakh- stania, and Siberia with Kazakhstania, resulting in the formation of the supercontinent, Pangea, by the early Permian (~300 Ma) ( see Figure 4.1 ; Rowley et al. , 1985 ; Rogers and Santosh, 2004 ; Vázquez, 2010 ). Pangea moved northward in latitude throughout the Permian by as much as 14 degrees according to some estimates, but the exact magni- tude of plate movement remains hotly debated. Against this backdrop of tectonic change were equally dramatic shift s in climate. In the early Permian, Gondwanan continents were locked in deep glaciation but by the mid-Permian, both geological and palaeonto- logical evidence suggests that warmer climatic conditions were developing ( Tabor and Poulsen, 2008 ; Eyles, 2008 ; Montañez and Poulsen, 2013 ). By the late Permian (~252 Ma; Figure 5.2 ), global climate was characterized by widespread aridity within continental interiors, high seasonal temperature fl uctuations, equatorial aridity (in contrast to the 05-WillisandMcElwain-Chap05.indd 14605-WillisandMcElwain-Chap05.indd 146 11/28/13 1:06 PM11/28/13 1:06 PM 147 5.1 ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES DURING THE PERMIAN (299–252 MA ) present situation), and monsoonal conditions particularly in the southern hemisphere ( Tabor and Poulsen, 2008 ). Th e transition from the Carboniferous to Permian is therefore characterized by a strong trend of climate drying, particularly at low tropical palaeolatitudes. One of many indica- tors of this long-term aridifi cation is the dramatic loss of coal deposits, which had been abundant across the tropical latitudes of Pangea (~12 ° S to 10 ° N) in the late Carbon- iferous (Pennsylvanian 318–299 Ma). Coal is derived from peat accumulation in wet climates where precipitation usually exceeds 1000 mm per year. Coals were replaced by fossil soils containing calcretes in Lower Permian rocks of the western US, western Europe, and northern Africa. As calcrete deposits today form in sub-humid to semi-arid climates, where evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation in most months of the year ( Tabor et al. , 2007 ), this has led to the suggestion that the equatorial palaeolatitudes of western and central Pangea became much drier during the Permian (reviewed in Tabor and Poulsen, 2008 ). Although the proposed mechanisms behind the dramatic aridifi cation of the Pangean climate are extremely complex ( Tabor and Poulsen, 2008 ), three main pro- cesses are thought to have been primarily responsible. First, atmospheric carbon dioxide Figure 5.1 Evolution and diversiﬁ cation of the seed plants during the Permian.

A palaeoclimate model experiment using Pangean palaeo- geography has shown that raising atmospheric CO 2 levels from one to eight times pre- sent levels would result in decreased precipitation in the continental interiors of Pangea by increasing continental temperatures, leading to increased evaporation and decreased soil moisture, thus decreasing convective precipitation over the supercontinent ( Peyser and Poulsen, 2008 ). Second, deglaciation of Gondwanan high latitudes would have had a knock-on eff ect at low latitudes by reducing the low-latitude temperature gradient. Th is in turn would have impacted on circulation of the Hadley cell resulting in reduced con- vective precipitation in tropical latitudes ( Peyser and Poulsen, 2008 ). Th ird, the suggested northward drift of the supercontinent Pangea by as much as 14 degrees would have had the eff ect of moving tropical coal-forming basins with year-round high precipitation into a subtropical climate zone with greatly reduced and more seasonal precipitation ( Tabor and Poulsen, 2008 ). The pattern of increased warming and aridification of Permian climates was there- fore in part driven by a long-term rise in atmospheric CO 2 as indicated by carbon cycle models and multiple proxy CO 2 records ( Montañez et al. , 2007 ; Figure 5.3 ). In con- trast, atmospheric oxygen levels reached peak levels for all Earth history in the earliest Permian (~280 Ma), coinciding with the zenith of Gondwanan glaciation. O 2 levels of 25 per cent and higher have been proposed by both model ( Bergman et al. , 2004 ) and proxy estimates ( Glasspool and Scott, 2010 ), followed by a slow decline to levels as low as 11 per cent, nearly half the current atmospheric concentration, by the end of the Permian ( Bergman et al. , 2004 ). Fossil charcoal records do not support such low values, Figure 5.2 Approximate continental positions by the late Permian.

In addition, in the southern hemisphere there was a major expansion of the seed fern group, the glossopterids. Th e cycads and ginkgos contain living and fossil repre- sentatives, although in Mesozoic time they had a much greater global distribution. Fossil evi- dence suggests, for example, that by the mid-Triassic (~240 Ma) their distribution extended as far north as Siberia and Greenland. Th e bennettites and glossopterids are now extinct. Cycadales Cycads are the most ancient lineage of living seed plants. Fossils bearing close morpho- logical similarities to living species of cycads have been found as far back as ~318 Ma Figure 5.3 Estimated variations in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (CO 2 ) during the past 600 million years based on model predictions ( Berner and Kothavala, 2001 ) and palaeo-proxy estimates (compiled by Royer et al. , 2004 ).

(It should be noted, however, that all current species of cycad result from a radiation that occurred ~12 Ma ( Nagalingum et al. , 2011 ). Th erefore, despite similar mor- phological characteristics, the current species should not be viewed as ‘living fossils’.) Vegetative and reproductive features Th ere are approximately 11 genera (and over 300 species) of cycads living in tropical, sub- tropical, Mediterranean and warm temperate regions of the world today (Mexico and the West Indies, Australia, and South Africa) ( Hill et al. , 2004 ). All types are dioecious (i.e. they have male and female plants, rather than both sexual organs on one plant) and there is no fossil evidence to suggest that there were ever monoecious plants in this group ( Th omas and Spicer, 1987 ). Th e fi rst fossil evidence for the cycads is from the lower Pennsylvanian (~318 Ma) ( Norstog and Nicholls, 1997 ; Taylor et al. , 2009 ) and like their present-day counter- parts, some species grew up to 15 m in height, although some of the earliest plants had short (<3 m), stout, and unbranched trunks with a crown of leaves. In extant groups of cycads, there are two types of leaves: pinnate leaves that look simi- lar to some simple fern fronds and are usually borne as an apical rosette (i.e. growing out of the top of the trunk), and scale leaves, which cover the upper part of the stem ( Figure 5.4 a). Th e scale leaves oft en disintegrate to form a fi brous sheath around the stem ( Bell, 1992 ), whereas the pinnate leaves leave behind distinctive fi brous leaf bases. All the leaves of extant species are evergreen. Cycad foliage is extremely common in the fos- sil record (especially as compression/impression fossils), oft en forming fossil leaf litters. Th ere is a possibility, therefore, that some extinct species may have had a deciduous habit. Usually the apical ‘fronds’ are preserved and these demonstrate a similar growth position to present-day cycads (i.e. at the top of the trunk). However, fossil leafl et morphology is highly varied and suggests that there were some early species of cycad that had entire leaves whereas others had divided, pinnately compound leaves. All these fossil leaves can be identifi ed as cycad, however, by the similarity of their epidermal and stomatal features and also, in most cases, by simple or open venation patterns ( Brashier, 1968 ; Taylor et al. , 2009 ) ( Figure 5.4 b). Th ere is much evidence in the fossil record for nearly complete cycad stems with mor- phological and anatomical features showing remarkable similarity to present-day taxa ( Stewart and Rothwell, 1993 ; Taylor and Taylor, 1993 ; Cleal and Th omas, 2009 ; Taylor et al. , 2009 ; Hermsen et al. , 2006 , 2009 ). Th ese features include a thick, oft en unbranched stem, which in cross section is a eustele. Th is is composed of a massive central core of pith surrounded by vascular tissue and then bark. Th e primary vascular tissue surrounding the pith is made up of vascular bundles containing xylem and a thin layer of secondary xylem surrounding the primary xylem. Additional support to the stem is also provided by the leaf bases, which provide a fi rm outer coating to the trunk. Short, squat cycads that are typical of those in the extant fl ora are fi rst seen in the fossil record in the Trias- sic of Antarctica (e.g. Antarcticycas , Figure 5.5 ) ( Hermsen et al. , 2006 ). However, species with more slender and branching habit have also been observed in the fossil record (e.g. Nilssoniocladus ) ( Spicer and Herman, 1996 ). Th is slender branching habit is generally not seen in extant cycads but has been observed as a response to physical trauma ( Giff ord and Foster, 1989 ). 05-WillisandMcElwain-Chap05.indd 15005-WillisandMcElwain-Chap05.indd 150 11/28/13 1:06 PM11/28/13 1:06 PM 151 5.2 EVOLUTION OF CYCADS, BENNETTITES, GINKGOS, GLOSSOPTERIDS, AND GNETALES Th e reproductive organs of the cycads are well documented in the fossil record. Th e fe- male plants possessed clusters of ovules situated on modifi ed leaves called megasporophylls ( Figure 5.4 c). Th e male reproductive structure also consisted of modifi ed leaves (microspor- ophylls), but each of the leaves had small, compact pollen sacs attached to their lower surface ( Figure 5.4 d). In extant groups, each pollen sac produces numerous pollen grains, which are boat-shaped and thin-walled, with one broad germination furrow (termed monocolpate) ( Figure 5.4 e). Similar examples have been found in the plant fossil record dating back as far as the early Permian (270 Ma) ( Traverse, 1988a ). Extant cycads are insect pollinated Figure 5.4 Early cycad tree: (a) habit; (b) detail of leaf cuticle indicating epidermal and stomatal features; (c) female reproductive structure (ovulate cone) with detail of megasporophyll and ovules (enlarged); (d) male reproductive structure (pollen cone) with detail of microsporophyll and pollen sacs (enlarged); (e) monocolpate pollen (~60 μm in diameter).

Th e observation of fossil coprolites (fossil- ized excrement) within middle Triassic aged (~245 Ma) cycad male cones ( Delemaya spinu- losa) fi lled with pollen grains hints that the origin of entemophily in cycads may stretch back more than 245 million years ( Klavins et al. , 2005 ). Th is method of pollination is in sharp contrast with the gymnosperm groups to which cycads are closely related including conifers and ginkgos; both of these clades are exclusively wind-pollinated (anemophilous). Cycads do share similarities with ginkgos and some of the earliest fossil conifers in their fertiliza- tion strategy, however, as they all release motile sperm following rupture of the pollen grain. Sperm then swim to the female archegonia rather than being delivered directly via a pollen tube as observed in more recent conifer families ( Poort et al. , 1996 ). Fossilized pollen tubes have been observed in extinct cycads although their function was likely to provide nutrition to the developing sperm rather than delivery of sperm to the egg ( see Figure 4.17 ). Th e very wide geographical spread of fossil cycad stems, leaves, and reproductive struc- tures from the tropics to high temperate and even polar latitudes indicates that cycads had a much wider range of both ecological and climatic tolerance than observed in extant species. Despite the relatively recent radiation of the extant group, the current diversity of cycad form, ecology, species, and climatic tolerances is a shadow of their Mesozoic existence.

Cycads also belong to the Lignophyte clade, as they produce second- ary xylem. Other groups belonging to the Lignophyte clade include progymnosperms, which were discussed in Chapter 4. Th e leaves of cycads are megaphylls rather than microphylls (seen in lycophytes) and this trait places them together with monilophytes within the Euphyllophyte clade ( Figure 5.6 ). However, phylogenetic analyses of only extant seed plant groups show that cycads are most closely related (i.e. a sister group) Figure 5.6 Evolutionary trees summarizing relationships among seed plants (spermatophytes) based on morphological data of extant and extinct groups (on left from Hilton and Bateman, 2006 ) and on molecules of extant plants only (on right from Burleigh and Matthews, 2004 ).

Morphological analysis of fossil plant vegetative and reproductive structures suggests that the cycads are most probably derived from a seed fern group such as Medullosaceae ( Stewart and Rothwell, 1993 ; see Figure 4.23 ), which dominated the tropical and warm temperate biomes of the late Carboniferous (~300 Ma). Th is is supported by some cladistic analyses of extinct and extant sperma- tophytes ( Crane, 1985 ), although not unanimously ( see Doyle and Donoghue, 1986 ; Rothwell and Serbet, 1994 ). Bennettitales Vegetative and reproductive features Bennettitales are an extinct group of spermatophytes. Th e fossil record of the group indicates a widespread global distribution and high diversity from the early Triassic to lower Cretaceous (~250–145 Ma). Th is group bears many morphological similarities to both extant and extinct cycads and for many years they were classifi ed as such. How- ever, a number of features have been found to suggest that, in fact, they were a discrete taxonomic group. In the literature, one of the most commonly cited examples of a genus within the bennettites is Williamsonia ( Figure 5.7 ), since it was originally proposed that these plants had reproductive structures with a superfi cial resemblance to angiosperm fl owers ( Arber and Parkin, 1908 ). Th is late Jurassic fossil plant had a reproductive organ that consisted of a bisexual reproductive axis bearing naked ovules above a series of pollen-bearing structures, the whole organ enclosed by large bracts ( Stewart and Rothwell, 1993 ; Taylor and Taylor, 1993 ). Th ese large bracts were thought to be equivalent to petals in an angiosperm fl ower. In addition, the position of the reproductive organ, erect and at the end of the branch, bore some similarities to extant insect-pollinated fl ower structures. Coleoptera and Diptera fl ies have been suggested as pollinators for this plant ( Crepet and Friis, 1987 ). Th e shape of the bennettite leaves was similar to those of cycads, in that they were frond-like and composed of long, slender rachises with numerous leafl ets (although some species had entire leaves) ( Figure 5.7 b). Th e compound leaves grew from an apical crown at the top of the trunk in a spiral arrangement and fossil evidence suggests that they were periodically deciduous, leaving behind a distinctive pattern of leaf bases on the trunk ( Figure 5.7 a). On fi rst examination, therefore, there is little diff erence between the cycads and bennettites. However, the epidermal structure of the leaf indicates signifi cant diff er- ences. For example, whereas the walls of the epidermal cells in cycads are relatively straight ( Figure 5.8 ), they were highly sinuous in many bennettites. In addition, bennettites had lateral subsidiary cells (on the outside edge of the guard cells) that were derived from the same mother cells as the guard cell. Th is type of stomatal arrangement is referred to as syndetocheilic ( Stewart and Rothwell, 1993 ). In cycads the subsidiary cells are not derived from the same mother cell as guard cells but from adjacent epidermal cells. Th is type of stomatal arrangement is referred to as haplocheilic ( Figure 5.8 ). Th e potential evolution- ary signifi cance of this simple developmental diff erence is that stomatal development in cycads is more gymnosperm-like whereas that of bennettites is more angiosperm-like 05-WillisandMcElwain-Chap05.indd 15405-WillisandMcElwain-Chap05.indd 154 11/28/13 1:06 PM11/28/13 1:06 PM 155 5.2 EVOLUTION OF CYCADS, BENNETTITES, GINKGOS, GLOSSOPTERIDS, AND GNETALES Figure 5.7 Early Bennettitalean tree, Williamsonia : (a) habit; (b) leaves (Zamites gigas) and their position on the frond; (c) epidermal structure of leaves (from Bell, 1992 ); (d) female reproductive structure; (e) male reproductive structure (‘ﬂ ower’); (f) pollen sac and pollen.

Th ere are also major diff erences in their reproductive biology (com- pare Figures 5.4 and 5.7 ). Th e stems of bennettites were composed of a large pith surrounded by a ring of vascu- lar tissue and the overall structure was eustelic. Numerous examples of fossil bennettite cones indicate that with one or two exceptions they were unisexual early in their radiation, but later became predominantly bisexual ( Stewart and Rothwell, 1993 ). Th e transition from unisexual to bisexual reproductive structures in seed plants is considered one of the most important steps in the evolution of the angiosperm fl ower (reviewed in Rudall et al. , 2011 ). Th e female cones or ‘fl owers’ consisted of ovules, which were covered with sterile scales and surrounded by a long integument, extended as a micropylar tube ( Bell, 1992 ) ( Figure 5.7 d). Th e male reproductive structure was composed of a whorl of leaves bearing small pollen sac-like structures, which consisted of fused sporangia, known as a synangium ( Figure 5.7 e,f). Th e pollen grains produced by these sporangia were similar to those of cycads in that they had a single furrow (monocolpate) ( Figure 5.7 f). Finally, the whole reproductive structure was enclosed in spirally arranged bracts that were origi- nally thought to have opened out in much the same way as a fl ower bud when conditions are suitable for pollination ( Wieland, 1915 ). Reinterpretation by Crepet ( 1996 ) , however, suggests that opening of the whole structure was unlikely due to structural constraints. Little is known about the actual mechanism by which the pollen reached the micropyle. Although both wind pollination and selfi ng have been suggested, evidence for male and female development that is out of phase in bisexual ‘fl owers’ of bennettites suggests that some form of animal pollination may have been utilized. Th e presence of fossilized pol- linator reward structures such as nectaries also hints at insect rather than exclusively wind pollination ( Taylor et al. , 2009 ).

Perhaps the most intriguing relationship, however, is the suggestion that bennettites were the pre- cursor to the angiosperms. Many bennettite reproductive structures have been referred to as ‘fl owers’, including, for example, two taxa discovered in rocks of middle Jurassic age (~176–169 Ma) from Yorkshire in England, namely Williamsoniella coronata and Williamsonia gigas . Although these pre-angiosperm fossil ‘fl owers’ demonstrate many shared characteristics with true angiosperm fl owers and phylogenetic studies suggest a close affi nity (e.g. Crane et al. , 1995 ), the presence of only one rather than two integu- ments surrounding the ovule and the lack of any convincing morphological intermedi- ates has led some to question this interpretation ( Hughes, 1994 ). Bennettitales belong to the Lignophyte clade ( Figure 4.22 , 4.31 ) with all other extinct and extant seed plants (spermatophytes) and progymnosperms, as they have the capacity to produce woody tissue. Th ey are also euphyllophytes as they produce megaphyll rather than microphyll leaves ( Figure 3.23 , 4.9 ). Ginkgoales Vegetative and reproductive structures Ginkgos have a fossil record extending back to approximately the early Permian (~280 Ma). Today they are represented by a single species, Ginkgo biloba (the maidenhair tree), which grows wild in parts of China but is widely used as an ornamental tree in botanical gardens throughout the world. At the height of their global radiation, plant fossil evidence suggests that at least 16 Ginkgoales genera formed a signifi cant part of the world vegetation ( Pearson, 1995 ). Th e remarkable morphological similarity between extinct fossil specimens and extant Ginkgo biloba ( Figure 5.9 ) has oft en led to the description of Ginkgo biloba as a ‘living fossil’ ( Stewart and Rothwell, 1993 ; Taylor and Taylor, 1993 ). Th e plant fossil record indicates that ginkgo leaves were borne on both long and short shoots on lateral branches of the main stem ( Figure 5.9 a). Th ere was great variation in leaf morphology between species ( Figure 5.9 b), ranging from wedge-shaped lamina with highly dissected margins to lanceolate leaves with an entire margin ( Taylor and Taylor, 1993 ). All ginkgo leaves (fossil and extant), however, are readily recognized by their dis- tinctive leaf shape, open dichotomous venation pattern, and in some cases, by their sto- matal characteristics ( Bell, 1992 ). Ginkgo stomata are oft en sunken and surrounded by epidermal cells with overarching papillae (protrusions of the epidermis) ( Figure 1.3 b). Modern Ginkgo biloba is deciduous and the large number of leaves found as leaf mats in the fossil record has led to the suggestion that this was also the case for its ancestors ( Th omas and Spicer, 1987 ; Herman and Spicer, 2010 ). Modern leaves of Ginkgo biloba are, however, extremely plastic in terms of size, shape, and even habit (deciduous/evergreen) when exposed to a wide range of experimental conditions (McElwain, pers. obs.) and it is possible that a range of leaf economies existed in the fossil record of the group, from fully deciduous to fully evergreen. 05-WillisandMcElwain-Chap05.indd 15705-WillisandMcElwain-Chap05.indd 157 11/28/13 1:06 PM11/28/13 1:06 PM 158 5 MA JOR EMERGENCE OF THE SEED PLANTS Presently Ginkgo biloba may grow up to 30 m in height with a laterally branching stem bearing both short and long shoots ( Figure 5.9 a). Leaves and reproductive struc- tures grow from both the long and short shoots. In cross section, the Ginkgo biloba stem is composed of a eustele containing large amounts of secondary xylem and dem- onstrates characteristics that are difficult to separate from some coniferous wood such as Pinus . Fossil evidence for stems of Ginkgo is scarce but material that is available suggests a similar stele arrangement. An investigation of the capacity of different seed plant groups to conduct water through the secondary xylem showed that both fossil and modern Ginkgo grouped closely with cycads and conifers in having moderate Figure 5.9 Ginkgo: (a) habit of G. biloba; (b) fossil (upper) and modern (lower) leaves; (c) fossil male reproductive structure; (d) fossil pollen; (e) female reproductive structure (fossil seed).

Ginkgo biloba is dioecious and therefore has both male and female plants. Th e male plants bear catkin-like structures, which arise in pairs in the axil of the leaves ( Figure 5.9 c). Each fertile structure bears 2–4 pollen sacs at the tip, which contain monocolpate pollen grains that are wind dispersed. Ginkgoales have a zoidogamous pollination strategy (like that of cycads in which male gametes (antherozoids) swim in a fi lm of liquid to fertilize the female gametes) ( Figure 4.17 ). Female plants possess ovules/seeds, which are usually borne in a similar manner to the male reproductive structures, in the leaf axils on erect stalks known as peduncles ( Figure 5.9 e). At maturity the ovules are 1.5–2.0 cm in diameter and are therefore much larger in size than most conifer seeds but are comparable to those of the cycads and medullosan seed ferns ( Stewart and Rothwell, 1993 ). Each ovule has an integument and associated micropyle, which produces a pollination drop. When the pollen lands on the ovule, a pollination tube germinates out from the grain but, similarly to cycads, each grain produces two motile sperm. Th ese are released into the liquid in the archegonian chamber above the female gametophyte and one swims into the archegonium. Th ere is evidence in the fossil record to suggest that there was much variation in reproductive structures between species. Examples include species that had over 100 small ovules attached singly on short stalks to a central axis ( Th omas and Spicer, 1987 ; Taylor et al. , 2009 ) and dichotomous branching stems bearing ovules ( Archangelsky and Cúneo, 1990 ). Ginkgo origins and relationships Despite major advances in both molecular and morphological phylogenetic studies, the evo- lutionary history of the Ginkgoales remains unresolved. Th is is mainly due to the fact that the ginkgos, both fossil and the only living species Ginkgo biloba , share many vegetative characteristics with cordaites and conifers but their reproductive structures are more simi- lar to those of cycads. Th ese morphological complexities are also refl ected in the molecular data, which show a variety of possible relationships between ginkgos and cycads and ginkgos and conifers. Furthermore, although there is a rich fossil record of ginkgo and ginkgo-like foliage, fossil reproductive structures are relatively rare and our ability to trace the evolu- tionary history of Ginkgoales and their possible ancestral group or groups is therefore made diffi cult. On the basis of the fossil leaves alone, it has been suggested that Dicranophyllum moorei , a late Carboniferous fossil plant with long, slender, forking leaves up to 10 cm long, is a possible Ginkgoalean ancestor. Without co-occurring ginkgo-like reproductive struc- tures, however, this suggestion remains controversial. To date, two lower Permian fossil plant genera, Trichopitys and Polyspermophyllum , are the oldest candidate ancestors. Both share vegetative and reproductive affi nities with Ginkgoales and are thus believed to be pos- sible ancestral forms ( Andrews, 1961 ; Archangelsky and Cúneo, 1990 ). Discovering more Ginkgoales and ginkgo-like reproductive structures in the fossil record will certainly be key to unravelling their evolutionary relationships in the future. What is known is that Ginkgoa- les are spermatophytes ( Figure 5.6 ), belong to the Lignophyte clade ( Figure 4.22 ), and are Euphyllophytes ( Figure 3.23 , 4.9 ). 05-WillisandMcElwain-Chap05.indd 15905-WillisandMcElwain-Chap05.indd 159 11/28/13 1:07 PM11/28/13 1:07 PM 160 5 MA JOR EMERGENCE OF THE SEED PLANTS Glossopteridaceae Vegetative and reproductive structures At least fi ve groups of seed ferns have been recognized in the fossil record ( Hilton and Bateman, 2006 ; Taylor et al. , 2009 ) using cladistics analysis of morphological traits. Th ese include hydrasperman, medullosan, peltaspermalean, callistophytalean, and higher seed ferns ( Hilton and Bateman, 2006 ). Glossopteridaceae belong to the ‘higher seed fern’ group- ing, which are the most closely related seed ferns to fl owering plants. Although the general characteristics of the seed ferns and their early fossil appearance are described in Chapter 4 , the fossil distribution of the seed fern group Glossopteridaceae needs to be mentioned here. Th is group dominated the fl ora of the southern hemisphere continent of Gondwana during the Permian (~299–251 Ma) and, like other groups, has also been suggested as a possible an- giosperm ancestor. Plants in this group are thought to have been predominantly arborescent and deciduous, with reproductive organs attached to highly modifi ed leaves. Over 200 spe- cies have been described, with fossil examples found in present-day localities of Australia, Africa, South America, Antarctica, and the Indian peninsula ( Stewart and Rothwell, 1993 ; Taylor et al. , 2009 ). Evidence from fossil wood suggests that glossopterids grew to approximately 10 m in height, with thick trunks of eustelic structure indicating a close similarity to the wood of modern Araucaria ( White, 1990 ) ( Figure 5.10 a). Th e trees were deciduous (as indicated by the presence of thick leaf mats of glossopteris leaves in Permian-aged rocks) and had leaves that were arranged in whorls ( Figure 5.10 a). Th e deciduous nature of glossopterids, taken together with evidence of clear growth rings, suggests that these trees fl ourished in a climate with a temperature and/or precipitation regime typical of our current temperate biome ( Ziegler, 1990 ). Th e fossil leaves are distinctive by their cross-connections between veins (anastomosing venation) ( Alvin and Chaloner, 1970 ), resulting in a net-venation pattern remarkably simi- lar to that typical of many angiosperm dicotyledon leaves ( see Chapter 6 ; Figure 5.10 b). Th e leaves typically have stomata only on the lower leaf surfaces. Th e stomata of glossopterids are very similar to those of the cycads, as both possess a ring of subsidiary cells surrounding the guard cells, derived from the adjacent epidermal cells (haplocheilic) ( Figure 5.8 b). Th e female reproductive structures of glossopterids are extremely diverse, including both uni-ovulate and multi-ovulate structures borne in both solitary and compound leaf and leaf-like structures ( Taylor et al. , 2009 ). Th ese have been grouped into two broad categories, namely the megafructi, which, as the name suggests, had large fructifi cations (seeds) located on unaltered foliage leaves, and the microfructi, in which smaller seeds were attached to modifi ed scale leaves ( White, 1990 ). Th e male reproductive structures were composed of fertile scales, sometimes aggregated into cones ( Figure 5.10 d) and had distinctive sporangia containing bisaccate, striated pollen grains ( Figure 5.10 e). Glossopteridales: origins and relationships Th e Glossopteridales appear to combine the characteristics of many other seed plant groups and have, yet again, been proposed as a plausible ancestor to the fl owering plants (angio- sperms), on the basis of similarity in both venation pattern ( Melville, 1983 ; Srivastava, 1991 ) 05-WillisandMcElwain-Chap05.indd 16005-WillisandMcElwain-Chap05.indd 160 11/28/13 1:07 PM11/28/13 1:07 PM 161 5.2 EVOLUTION OF CYCADS, BENNETTITES, GINKGOS, GLOSSOPTERIDS, AND GNETALES Figure 5.10 Glossopteris tree: (a) habit; (b) leaf indicating net venation pattern; (c) female reproductive structure; (d) male reproductive structures; (e) pollen.

However, this is now thought to be unlikely ( Hughes, 1994 ). Based on a detailed morphological comparison, Hil- ton and Bateman ( 2006 ) have shown that glossopterids are closely related to Caytoniales ( see Section 5.4 ), which are the closest extinct seed plant group to angiosperms. Glossopteridales are members of the Lignophyte clade ( Figure 4.22 ) and are Euphyllophytes ( Figure 3.23 , 4.9 ); however, their position within seed plants (spermatophytes) is not yet well resolved. Only one of many hypothesized topologies for extinct and extant seed plants is shown in Figure 5.6 . Gnetales Vegetative and reproductive structures Gnetales are a relatively small seed plant lineage made up of three living families, each of which contains a single genus: Ephedraceae, Gnetaceae, and Welwitschiaceae ( Figure 5.11 ). Th e fossil record of the group extends back to the early Cretaceous; however, it is possible based on molecular clock estimates that they diverged from conifers as early as the mid to late Permian ( Renner, 2009 ), at a time when Pangean climates were becoming increasingly arid. Th e fossil record of Gnetales is based predominantly on pollen, wood, seeds, and a single spectacular fossil seedling. Fossil pollen and seed discoveries from Portugal, North America, and Lake Baikal demonstrate that Ephedra and its ancestors had a widespread distribution across the Lauratian continent by the Albian (~110 Ma) ( Krassi- lov, 1986 ; Rydin et al. , 2006 ). Furthermore, strong similarities in fossil and modern pollen ( Figure 5.11 a,c) and seed morphology suggest that the reproductive biology of Ephedra has remained unchanged over the past 120 million years ( Rydin et al. , 2006 ). Th e fossil record of Gnetum is currently unknown; however, Welwitschia is represented in the fossil record by abundant polyplicate pollen (with long striations from pole to pole; Figure 5.11 ) and a remarkable fossil seedling, Cratonia cotyledon , which was discovered in the famous Cretaceous aged (~112 Ma) Crato locality in Brazil ( Rydin et al. , 2003 ). C. cotyledon has been unambiguously identifi ed as an ancestor of Welwitschia based on its highly diagnos- tic Y-shaped venation pattern, a structure for moisture absorption called a feeder in the seedling, and syndetocheilic stomata ( Figure 5.8 ). Gnetales: origins and relationships Gnetales share vegetative and reproductive traits with angiosperms, such as vessels in the xylem, ovules with a double integument, and double fertilization. Th is observation led to the anthophyte hypothesis ( Crane, 1985 ), which stated that Gnetales are the closest liv- ing seed plant lineage to angiosperms. However, most molecular phylogenetic analyses using genes from multiple organelles no longer support this hypothesis and instead sug- gest that Gnetales are a highly derived group within the conifers (termed the ‘gnepines hypothesis’ ( Chaw et al. , 2000 )) or are the closest living relatives of all conifers (‘gnetifers hypothesis’). If either of these hypotheses is correct it suggests that many of the shared traits of angiosperms and Gnetales could have arisen due to convergent evolution in the Cretaceous. Th e parallel appearance of highly reticulate veined leaves and vessels in both Gnetales and angiosperms could have been driven by a long-term trend of atmospheric 05-WillisandMcElwain-Chap05.indd 16205-WillisandMcElwain-Chap05.indd 162 11/28/13 1:07 PM11/28/13 1:07 PM 163 5.2 EVOLUTION OF CYCADS, BENNETTITES, GINKGOS, GLOSSOPTERIDS, AND GNETALES Figure 5.11 Living and fossil Gnetales: (a) fossil and (c) modern pollen grains of Ephedra showing distinct polyplicate morphology with ridges and valleys; (b) young ovulate cones of Ephedra foeminea showing micropylar tubes (on right-hand cone) extending to facilitate pollination via the pollen drop mechanism; (d) illustration of modern Gnetum showing oppositely arranged leaves and 5 ovules at the branch tip; (e) Ephedra sp. showing reduced scale-like leaves arranged in whorls.

Both traits would have conferred a physiological advantage, as low CO 2 atmospheres would exert strong selection pressure for enhanced transpiration capacity to balance the increased diff usion of CO 2 into the leaf ( McElwain et al. , 2005 ). By the end of the Cretaceous the diversity of Gnetales contracted dramatically ( Crane et al. , 1995 ; Crane 1996 ); today the three living genera, Ephedra , Welwitschia , and Gnetum , are geographically restricted to arid habitats in the case of the two former genera and to predominantly moist tropical forests in the case of Gnetum . Welwitschia is perhaps the most interesting living member of the Gnetales. It is a monospecifi c genus found only in the Namibian desert of Africa. It possesses only two leaves, which grow continuously for its entire life, and has evolved a novel photosynthetic biochemistry, called crasulacean acid metabolism (CAM) ( see Chapter 7 ). 5.3 Biogeographical distribution of global vegetation during the middle Permian (270–260 Ma) Th e Permian (~299–251 Ma) was characterized by major global climate change, from a gla- ciated (icehouse) to completely ice-free (hothouse) state ( see Section 5.1 ). Not surprisingly, this dramatic climate change was refl ected by marked changes in composition, dominance patterns, and biogeographical distribution of world vegetation. One of the most striking fea- tures of these vegetation changes was the increased proportion of seed plants in global fl oras by the middle Permian and reduction of the swamp-dwelling lycopsids and sphenopsids ( Ziegler, 1990 ) ( Figure 5.12 ). Th ese fl oristic changes, together with evidence for increased provinciality, provide a strong signature of increased aridity and greater pole to equator temperature gradients. Biome-level biogeographical analyses of the middle Permian, based on a sophisticated multivariate statistical approach, have identifi ed seven distinct biomes ( Ziegler, 1990 ; Rees et al. , 1999 ), which will be discussed in this section.

In the northern hemisphere this biome incorporated present-day eastern Siberia and in the southern hemisphere, present-day Antarctica and southern Australia. In the northern hemisphere (also known as the An- garan realm) the vegetation was dominated by cordaites and sphenopsids, whereas in the southern hemisphere (the Gondwanan realm) glossopterids (with at least six diff erent spe- cies) and sphenopsids were predominant. Lithological data and climate model projections, together with the relative low-diversity fossil fl oras in these areas, are indicative of cool climates typical of the cool temperate biome ( Rees et al. , 1999 ). Seasonality in tempera- ture, another typical climatic feature of this biome, is supported by evidence of growth rings in fossil wood and extensive leaf mats of both glossopterids and cordaites, indicating deciduousness. Cool temperate biome Th e cool temperate biome, which covered a signifi cant proportion of the high latitudes in both hemispheres, included present-day South Africa, India, Madagascar, and Australia in the southern hemisphere and Siberia in the northern hemisphere. Fossil fl oras from these regions show relatively greater diversity than in the higher-latitude cold temperate biome. Palaeobotanical evidence, such as growth rings and the presence of deciduous- ness, indicates that despite relatively high species diversity, climates were distinctly sea- sonal. In the northern hemisphere the vegetation was composed mainly of cordaites and sphenopsids with some ferns, but in the southern hemisphere fl oras contained a high proportion of glossopterids. Intriguingly, in the northern hemisphere, the cool temper- ate biome, together with the tropical everwet biome, is characterized by the presence of the last remnants of the water-loving lycopsid fl ora that were so extensive during the late Carboniferous. Warm temperate biome Th e vegetation spanning northernmost North America, Greenland, and Scandinavia in the northern hemisphere and northern India, Western Australia, and Chile in the southern hemisphere has been classifi ed as a warm temperate biome. In the northern hemisphere this was characterized by high diversity and composed of cordaites, peltasperms (a pteridosperm group), ginkgos, sphenopsids, and ferns, whereas in the southern hemisphere glossopterids were predominant. Mid-latitude desert biome Th e mid-latitude desert is marked in the southern hemisphere by an abundance of evaporite deposits indicating aridity. Th ere are no fossil fl oras present in this biome during the middle Permian. 05-WillisandMcElwain-Chap05.indd 16605-WillisandMcElwain-Chap05.indd 166 11/28/13 1:07 PM11/28/13 1:07 PM 167 5.4 MA JOR RADIATION OF THE CONIFERS AND OTHER SEED PLANT LINEAGES Subtropical desert biome Th e predominance of evaporites in what is now northern Africa, northern South America, and much of Europe and North America, is used to designate these low palaeotropical latitudes as the subtropical desert biome ( Rees et al. , 1999 ) ( Figure 5.12 ). Palaeobotani- cal evidence indicates that these great Permian deserts were not totally devoid of vegeta- tion, but on the coast supported cycads, ginkgos, and conifers (Volziales) at some localities ( Rees et al. , 1999 ). Summerwet (tropical) biome Th e low equatorial latitudes were characterized by a more depauperate fl ora than the tem- perate belts, composed mainly of Ginkgoales and conifers (Volziales) with some cordaites. Th e xerophytic nature of the vegetation, including the small, scale-like leaves of the Volziales and the fi nely divided leaves of the early ginkgos, are suggestive of a climate prone to season- ality in precipitation regimes. Tropical everwet biome Th e increased aridity and seasonality of the global climate between 270 and 260 Ma is also strikingly demonstrated by the displacement of the tropical everwet biome from the continental interior of Pangea, where it straddled the equatorial latitudes in the upper Carboniferous, to China (referred to as the Cathasian Realm). Th is biome, which occupied what is now northern China, was composed of medulosan pteridosperms, sphenopsids, ferns, and Ginkgoales and was dominated by large-leaved gigantopterids (another group of seed ferns or pteridosperms) ( Ziegler, 1990 ; Rees et al. , 1999 ). 5.4 Major radiation of the conifers and other seed plant lineages Conifers are cone-bearing plants that have a distinctive wood, which lacks vessels and instead has tracheids with large, bordered pits. Resin is produced in the wood or leaves and conducted through resin canals. Th ey have simple leaves that are single or parallel veined and reproductive organs that are separated into male (pollen cones) and female (seed cones) structures. In terms of their chloroplast DNA they are also distinctive; conifers, unlike all other plants, only have one copy of a large inverted repeat in the chloroplast DNA ( Farjon, 2008 ). From the fossil record there are 12 conifer families (now extinct) in addition to the eight families that are currently found all over the world. Th e earliest conifer in the fossil record, Swillingtonia denticulata , was discovered from an upper Carboniferous locality (Westphalian B, ~310 Ma) in Yorkshire. Although conifers were not a major component of lowland global vegetation at this time, it is suggested that they most probably inhabited the drier environments of upland areas ( Scott and Chaloner, 1983 ), from which they subsequently radiated. Th e presence of conifers in 05-WillisandMcElwain-Chap05.indd 16705-WillisandMcElwain-Chap05.indd 167 11/28/13 1:07 PM11/28/13 1:07 PM 168 5 MA JOR EMERGENCE OF THE SEED PLANTS the plant fossil record increased throughout the Permian ( Miller, 1988 ). However, it was not until the Triassic period (~245–208 Ma) that this group underwent a major radiation ( Figure 5.1 ) with the fi rst occurrence and subsequent diversifi cation of seven conifer fami- lies (Podocarpaceae, Taxaceae, Araucariaceae, Cupressaceae, Taxodiaceae, Cephalotax- aceae, and Pinaceae) ( Figure 5.13 ) that have a widespread distribution today ( Archibold, 1995 ). Th is radiation occurred against a climatic background of increasingly warm and seasonally wet/dry conditions, with further increases in atmospheric CO 2 ( Figure 5.3 ) and the suggestion that a ‘megamonsoonal’ system had developed over the interior of Pangea ( Parrish, 1993 ). Conifers are diff erent from cycads and ginkgos in that they produce pollen, which deliv- ers sperm nuclei directly to the egg by means of a pollen tube and have pollen grains that Figure 5.13 First appearance of the extant conifer families in the geological record.

Th is feature enables the pollen to be more eff ective in reaching the ovule by fl oating in the pollination drop exuding from the micropyle ( Leslie, 2010 ). The earliest fossil evidence for trees bearing some or all of these conifer-like charac- teristics spans a period from the late Carboniferous to early Permian (~310–260 Ma). The latter part of this range coincides with the first appearance in the fossil record of ginkgos and cycads. These early conifers have been placed in a group called the Utrechti- aceae ( Taylor and Taylor, 1993 ), formerly known as the Lebachiaceae ( Florin, 1938 ) and Walchiaceae ( Clement-Westerhof, 1988 ). There are no extant members of this group. Coniferales Vegetative and reproductive structures One of the most commonly cited fossil examples of Permian conifers is Utrechtia ( Figure 5.15 ). Fossil evidence indicates that Utrechtia was a tree or shrub that reached heights of 5 m and had a stem composed of a eustele with a relatively large pith and tracheids showing distinct annual rings. Th ese conifers bear a close morphological similarity to many extant conifers and bear resemblance to the slender conical Araucaria species such as Araucaria heterophylla (the Norfolk Island pine) ( Farjon, 2008 ). The leaves of Utrechtia were microphyllous and needle-like in appearance and spirally arranged about twigs. In turn, the twigs were attached to branches that were arranged in whorls (usually 5–6 branches in a whorl) about a slender monopodial stem ( Figure 5.15 a).

Fossil evidence for cone-like reproductive structures borne on leafy shoots is thought to represent the female structure ( Figure 5.15 b), whereas evidence for the male structure producing pollen cones suggests that it was very similar to those of extant conifers ( Th omas and Spicer, 1987 ) ( Figure 5.15 c). Th e female cones consisted of an axis, approximately 8 cm long, that was borne on a reduced leaf with a reproductive structure (a fertile scale) in its axil ( Figure 5.15 b). Th is fertile, short shoot seen in the fossil Utrechtia is regarded by many palaeobotanists as the morphological intermediate between the female reproductive structure of cordaites and the ovuliferous scale of a modern conifer ( Bell, 1992 ). In contrast, the male reproductive pollen-producing cones were composed of helically arranged fl attened scales, each producing a stalk bearing two pollen sacs. Th e pollen of Utrechtia was monosaccate (having a single sac enclosing the grain; Figure 5.15 d), although nothing is known about the process of fertilization in these early conifers. Coniferales: origins and relationships A detailed investigation on the origin of conifers led to the hypothesis that all modern co- nifers (excluding the Taxaceae) are derived from the Utrechtiaceae (Lebachiaceae) via the Voltziales ( Florin, 1951 ). Th is interpretation is supported by early cladistic analysis ( Miller, 1982 ). Furthermore, the Voltziales are oft en regarded as having shared a common ancestor with the cordaites. However, the extent to which all extant and extinct conifers can be re- garded as being derived from a single common ancestor (i.e. a monophyletic group or clade) has been a matter of much debate, (e.g. Crane, 1985 ; Doyle and Donoghue, 1986 ; Miller, 1988 ; Rothwell and Serbet, 1994 ). However, most phylogenies (e.g. Burleigh and Mathews, 2004 ; Doyle, 2008 ) based on morphological and molecular evidence now place them as monophyletic ( Figure 5.16 ). Th e surprising fi nd over the last decade is the placement of Gnetales within conifers (‘gnepines hypothesis’) according to some phylogenetic analyses ( Chaw et al. , 2000 , e.g. Figure 5.16 ) rather than sister to conifers as previously hypothesized and illustrated in Figure 5.6 . Caytoniales From ~250 Ma onwards (Triassic to Cretaceous), an additional small group of distinctive seed ferns became apparent in the fossil record, loosely named the Caytoniales. Th is group, which are now extinct, are important to mention because they bear a number of distinctive characteristics to suggest they are angiosperm progenitors ( Taylor et al. , 2009 ). A particularly interesting fossil in this group is Catyonia , which has a number of morphological features similar to angiosperms including reticulate leaf venation and cupule structures bearing the ovule ( Doyle, 2006 ). To understand the importance of these features it is necessary to also briefl y describe some of the distinctive features of angiosperm reproductive organisms (see also Chapter 6 ). A distinctive feature of the angiosperm ovule compared to other seed plants is that it has two integuments covering the ovule and it is usually bent back on itself, with the opening for pollen to enter (the micropyle) situated close to the stalk ( Figure 5.17 a). In contrast, gymnosperms have a single integument covering the ovule and the whole structure 05-WillisandMcElwain-Chap05.indd 17105-WillisandMcElwain-Chap05.indd 171 11/28/13 1:07 PM11/28/13 1:07 PM 172 5 MA JOR EMERGENCE OF THE SEED PLANTS is usually held upright on the stalk, with the micropyle opposite the stalk ( Figure 5.17 b). In some fossil gymnosperms, however, and in particular the Caytoniales, the fossil evidence suggests an ovule that was almost completely enclosed, with a small opening close to the stalk of the cupule ( Frohlich and Parker, 2000 ; Doyle, 2006 ; Frohlich and Chase, 2007 : Fig- ure 5.17 c). Th e cupule of Caytonia has been interpreted as being homologous to the outer integument of angiosperms (i.e. both structures are evolutionarily related in some way). Fos- sil evidence indicates that up to 6–7 cupules were born on the female reproductive stalks of Caytonia ( Figure 5.17 d). Male stalks bore the pollen sacs of Caytonia (oft en referred to as Caytonanthus ). Each branch on the stalk ( Figure 5.17 e) bore 1–4 elongate pollen sacs (~1 cm long) ( Taylor and Taylor, 2009 ). Pollen grains of Caytonanthus were bisaccate and ~20–30 microns in diam- eter, which is similar to other gymnosperms and suggests that they had a pollination system where the pollen fl oats on the pollination drop and is fl oated up the micropylar canals to- wards the ovule ( Leslie, 2010 ). It was originally thought that the lip-like opening of the cupule ( Figure 5.17 c) could have acted like a stigma in angiosperm fl owers, with the pollen placed on the lip and a pollination tube growing down into the pollination chamber of the ovule ( Th omas, 1925 ). However, it is now suggested that pollination in these plants occurred via a pollination drop, similar to extant gymnosperms ( Taylor and Taylor, 2009 ; Cleal and Th omas, 2009 ).

Th ey have a charac- teristic mid-vein and reticulate lateral veins branching out from this ( Figure 5.18 ). In terms of physical structure, Caytoniales are thought to have been small trees but the reproductive organs described have, as yet, never been found in the fossil record attached to the wood or leaves. Caytoniales: origins and relationships Th e Caytoniales appear to combine the characteristics of many other seed plant groups yet have a number of characteristics that link them more closely to the angiosperms. A synthesis of morphological data sets ( Doyle, 2006 ) incorporating extant taxa as well as fossils indicates that the Caytoniales clade is the closest relative of angiosperms ( Hilton and Bateman, 2006 ), followed by Bennettitales, Glossopterids, and Gnetales ( Soltis et al. , 2008 ) ( Figure 5.6 ). Th ere is, however, still some debate regarding the relative position of the Bennettitales in this pro- posed phylogeny ( see Friis et al. , 2007 ; Rothwell et al. , 2009 ) and agreeing on the fossil lineages that represent the closest link to the angiosperms has not been universally resolved ( Frohlich and Chase, 2007 ; Hilton and Bateman, 2006 ; Soltis et al. , 2008 ; Rothwell et al. , 2009 ). 5.5 Biogeographical distribution of global vegetation during the early Jurassic (201–182 Ma) By the early Jurassic, both the composition and distribution of global vegetation had al- tered dramatically. Cordaites, gigantopterids, and glossopterids no longer dominated world fl oras. Instead they were replaced by cycads, bennettites, ginkgos, Caytoniales, and conifers Figure 5.17 Diagram illustrating (a) angiosperm ovule (ov) protected by two integuments, an inner integument (ii) and an outer integument (oi); (b) gymnosperm ovule protected by a single integument; and (c) ovules of Caytonia each protected by a single integument and all within a cupule.

Five distinct vegetation biomes have been identifi ed for the early Jurassic (Pliensbachian, ~190–182 Ma) ( Rees et al. , 1999 ) ( Figure 5.19 ). Th e methods used in the recognition of these biomes build on earlier statistical work ( Ziegler, 1990 , 1993 ) and utilize correspondence analysis to arrange the occurrences of fossil plants according to their degree of association ( Rees et al. , 1999 ). Cool temperate biome In the high latitudes (>60°) of both hemispheres a cool temperate biome has been recognized ( Figure 5.19 ; Rees et al. , 1999 , 2000 ). Th e fossil fl oras that defi ne this biome are characterized by relatively low species diversity with a high proportion of deciduous species. Fossil woods from these fl oras display well-defi ned growth rings, indicating seasonality ( Vakhrameev, 1991 ). Th is biome is further characterized by the dominance of ginkgos and macrophyl- lous (large-leaved) conifers, together with ferns and sphenopsids. Th e dominant conifers included woody and herbaceous members of the Pinaceae and Voltziales ( Meyen, 1987 ). In total it has been estimated that there was a minimum of 70 genera and over 120 species Figure 5.18 Sagenopteris .

Warm temperate biome Th e cool temperate biome grades into a warm temperate biome at palaeolatitudes below 60° and centred on 40°. Th e fossil fl oras of this biome were of exceptionally high diversity, composed of ferns, sphenopsids, macrophyllous cycads and conifers, and, to a lesser ex- tent, ginkgos. Conifer families present in this biome included Pinaceae, Taxodiaceae, and Podocarpaceae ( Vakhrameev, 1991 ). Macrophyllous cycads and bennettites were also ex- tremely abundant. Th e high diversity of warm temperate biome fl oras relative to those of the cool temperate biome is striking, and it is estimated that by 200 million years ago there were at least 200 genera and over 500 species established in this biome ( Meyen, 1987 ). It is interesting to note that in the greenhouse world of the early Jurassic, the warm temperate biome of the mid-temperate latitudes and not the tropical everwet biome, was the most diverse and productive of world biomes ( Rees et al. , 2000 ). Winterwet biome A winterwet biome, which may have possessed a climate similar to that of the Medi- terranean region today, occupied a narrow band of North America in the northern hemisphere and western Australia, India, and the southernmost tip of South America in the southern hemisphere. This biome was dominated by microphyllous (small-leaved) cycads, bennettites, and conifers, with some ferns and sphenopsids ( Rees et al. , 2000 ). The relatively increased proportion of plants with small leaves and other xerophytic features, together with a decline in the proportion of vegetation with water-loving characteristics, clearly indicates seasonal water deficits. Such features are typical of the winterwet biome. Subtropical desert biome A subtropical desert biome occupied present-day western and southern North America and southern Africa and South America in the northern hemisphere ( Rees et al. , 2000 ) ( Figure 5.19 ). Th e absence of fossil fl oras, together with an abundance of evaporites and wind-blown (aeolian) sediments, supports the presence and extent of this biome. Summerwet (tropical) biome A summerwet biome has been recognized in a broad equatorial band incorporating early Jurassic fossil localities in present-day southern Mexico, Cuba, Columbia, northern Bra- zil, northern Africa, and Israel. Th is biome was dominated by microphyllous bennettites, numerous ferns including Weichselia (which is thought to have possessed xerophilic char- acters) ( Vakhrameev, 1991 ), and microphyllous conifers, including members of the Cu- pressaceae and Podocarpaceae. Cycads were rare and groups such as ginkgos and conifer families (including Pinaceae) were also absent from these fl oras. 05-WillisandMcElwain-Chap05.indd 17505-WillisandMcElwain-Chap05.indd 175 11/28/13 1:07 PM11/28/13 1:07 PM 176 5 MA JOR EMERGENCE OF THE SEED PLANTS Summary 1. During the period spanning the Permian (290–252 Ma) a major transformation occurred in global vegetation, with the emergence and widespread radiation of the seed plants. 2. Although two seed plant groups evolved earlier, during the middle Carboniferous (cordaites and early pteridosperms), the new seed plant groups to emerge between 280 and 260 Ma included the cycads, ginkgos, bennettites, glossopterids, and Gnetales. 3. Th is time of major fl oral evolution occurred against a backdrop of increasing global warmth and aridity – with widespread aridity within continental interiors, high seasonal temperature fl uctuations, equatorial aridity (in contrast to the present situation), and monsoonal conditions particularly in the southern hemisphere. 4. Th e formation of the supercontinent Pangea by 300 Ma is thought to be one of the main reasons accounting for this global climate change. Th e new supercontinent would have altered global climate patterns through greatly increased continentality and the creation of extensive uplands. In addition there was a dramatic increase in atmospheric CO 2 from levels of ~300 ppm to ~1500 ppm and atmospheric oxygen levels reached peak levels for all Earth history in the earliest Permian (~280 Ma). 5. Analyses of the biogeographical distribution of global vegetation between 270 and 260 Ma (middle Permian) indicate seven distinct biomes: cold temperate; cool temperate; warm temperate; mid-latitude desert; subtropical desert; summerwet; and tropical everwet. 6. Evolution and radiation of the conifers occurred between ~248–206 Ma (Triassic). Seven conifer families that radiated at this time still have widespread global coverage today.

Biogeographical distribution of the early Jurassic global vegetation (201–182 Ma) indicates that global vegetation by this time was dominated by seed plants and that fi ve distinctive vegetation biomes can be recognized: cool temperate; warm temperate; winterwet; subtropical desert; and tropical summerwet. A tropical everwet biome was absent. 9. By the early Jurassic, global fl oras, for the fi rst time, contained a signifi cant component of vegetation with recognizable present-day forms. 05-WillisandMcElwain-Chap05.indd 17805-WillisandMcElwain-Chap05.indd 178 11/28/13 1:07 PM11/28/13 1:07 PM 6 Flowering plant origins Flowering plants (angiosperms: Magnoliophyta) are the dominant plants in the world today, accounting for 457 families and between 270,000 and 400,000 species (compared to approximately 10,000 species of pteridophytes and 750 species of gymnosperms). However, in evolutionary terms, fl owering plants are relatively recent, with molecular evidence sug- gesting an origination date between 180–140 Ma and evidence for their fi rst appearance in the fossil record from around 139 Ma (lower Cretaceous). Rapid diversifi cation and radiation of the angiosperms occurred around 100 Ma such that by the early Cenozoic (~65 Ma), only 70 million years aft er their fi rst appearance in the fossil record, angiosperms had attained ecological dominance in a majority of habitats and over a wide geographical area. As a group, therefore, even though they evolved some 330 million years later than the fi rst land plants and 230 million years later than the fi rst seed plants, they are of profound evolutionary in- terest. Th is chapter examines the evidence for the fi rst fl owering plants, considers various theories as to why their appearance was so late in the geological record, and discusses the proposed evolutionary pathways leading to angiosperm evolution. 6.1 Evidence for the ﬁ rst angiosperms Features used to separate extant angiosperms from other seed plants include the enclosed na- ture of the ovary (the carpel), ovules that have a double-layered seed coat (two integuments), and the presence of fl owers, where pollen- and ovule-producing organs are grouped into a structural unit ( Magallón, 2009 ). An additional distinguishing feature (although there are ex- ceptions) is the possession of specialized conducting cells in the xylem and phloem and pollen with a distinctive grain wall made up of columellae. A number of characteristics of the angio- sperm life cycle are also distinctive, including a process of double fertilization, whereby two sperms are released from the pollen tube into the embryo sac (present in each ovule – there may be several ovules within the ovary). One sperm fuses with the egg to form the zygote (which di- vides immediately aft er fertilization to form the embryo), and the other sperm fuses with two polar nuclei in the centre of the embryo sac to produce the primary endosperm (the storage tissue in the seed) ( Figure 6.1 ). Th e angiosperms were traditionally divided into monocoty- ledons and dicotyledons; however, this division is no longer supported by systematic studies. 06-WillisandMcElwain-Chap06.indd 17906-WillisandMcElwain-Chap06.indd 179 11/28/13 2:20 PM11/28/13 2:20 PM 180 6 FLOWERING PLANT ORIGINS Figure 6.1 Simpliﬁ ed angiosperm life cycle.

Th e former three lineages are collectively known as the ANITA group or grade and the latter fi ve are known as the ‘core’ angiosperms and contain the majority of the living angiosperm species. Th e features that group angiosperms as a division and separate these diff erent lineages ( Table 6.1 ) appear to have persisted from early stages of angiosperm evolution. Evidence from the fossil record suggests that angiosperms, following their fi rst appear- ance in the fossil record between ~139–125 million years ago (early Cretaceous), under- went major radiation, leading to a global distribution, during the Albian–Cenomanian (~112–90 Ma) ( Figure 6.2 ). Th e earliest fossil evidence for angiosperms is represented in the record as fl ower parts, fruits, leaves, wood, and pollen ( Table 6.2 ) as follows. Flowers and ﬂ ower parts Some of the earliest known fossil fl owers, dating back to approximately the Early Cretaceous (129–113 Ma) (Barremian to Aptian), have been found in deposits from Portugal, North America (reviewed in Friis et al. , 2006 ), and China ( Sun et al. , 1998 ). Over 100 diff erent angio- sperm taxa have been identifi ed in the deposits from Vale de Agua in Portugal, which contain fossil remains of fl owers, fruits, and seeds ( Friis et al. , 2001 ).

Another early fossil fl ower (Early Cretaceous), also from Portugal, is Teixeiraea lusitanica ( von Balthazar et al. , 2005 ). Th is fossil represents a fl oral bud just before opening and is, again, very small (approximately 3.5 mm long and 2 mm wide). Th e fl oral bud is unisexual (male), contains numerous stamens (c. 20), and a particularly important feature is the presence of tricolporate pollen grains ( Table 6.1 ). Th ese features and a number of other characteristics indicate a close affi nity to the extant Ranunculaceae family and this fl ower bud probably represents a very early example of the evolving Eudicot lineage. Fossil fl oral structures from China come from an exceptionally well preserved early Cretaceous lake locality from the Yixan Formation in the Jehol Group ( Sun et al. , 1998 , 2002 ). Th e locality dates from the late Hauterivian to early Aptian (~128 to 121 Ma; Zhou et al. , 2003 ) and preserves almost entire specimens of early aquatic angiosperms, together Figure 6.3 An illustration of early fossil ﬂ owers and their stratigraphic placement in the fossil record. Archaefructus sinensis was discovered in freshwater lake sediments in China ( Sun et al. , 1998 ), the Nymphaeales fossil from Vale de Agua in Portugal is charcoaliﬁ ed from a wildﬁ re event ( Friis et al. , 2001 ), and Archaeanthus linnenbergi is preserved as a compression/impression fossil ( Dilcher and Crane, 1984 ).

An example of these early fl oral struc- tures comes from three diff erent species of Archaefructus which display extremely simple infl orescences consisting of paired or single carpels containing ovules (seeds) above paired stamens with anthers containing monosulcate pollen ( Figure 6.3 ) ( Sun et al. , 1998 , 2002 ). Th e infl orescences have no petals, sepals, or subtending bracts. Recent analysis suggests that Archaefructus may be related to the extant aquatic angiosperms Hydatellaceae (Nymphae- ales) or Ceratophyllum ( Friis et al. , 2003 ; Endress and Doyle, 2009 ). Th e morphological simplicity of these early fl owers may therefore be explained by their likely aquatic ecology, where the protective function of bracts against desiccation would not be required if the fl owers developed under water and the attractive function of perianth would not be needed if the pollen was water dispersed ( Friis et al. , 2003 ; Endress and Doyle, 2009 ). Th e earliest fossil fl owers from North America have been recovered from the Early and Mid Cretaceous Potomac group sediments in Virginia and Maryland ( Friis et al. , 2006 ). Two fl ow- ers of particular note are from the Puddledock locality in Virginia ( von Balthazar et al. , 2007 , 2008 ), namely Potomacanthus lobatus and Carpestella lacunata . Th e former fossil indicates a small (2 mm long, 1 mm wide) bisexual fl ower with the stamens in a distinctive whorl and con- taining reticulate pollen with no furrows or pores. Th is fl ower shares many similarities with fl owers of the extant Lauraceae and suggests the early diversifi cation of the Laurels within the Magnoliid lineage ( von Balthazar et al. , 2007 ). Carpestella lacunata , in comparison, indicates a small (0.65 mm long, 0.45 mm wide) bisexual fl ower with up to 60 stamens and 13 radially arranged carpels. On the basis of the large number of stamens and carpels and other morpho- logical characteristics, it is suggested that this plant is closely related to taxa that diverged early in the evolution of the angiosperms, probably in the Nymphaeales or Austrobaileyales lineage ( von Balthazar et al. , 2008 ). Th e characteristic ‘starlike’ carpel arrangement, for example, is found in extant Nymphaeaceae and Illicium (within the family Illiciaceae, Austrobaileyales). A large number of localities containing fossil fl owers now exist ( see Table 6.2 ). In sum- mary of the features and trends observed in these early fl owers and infl orescences, the following observations have been made ( Friis et al. , 2001 ): ● Th e earliest fossil fl owers were very small, generally ranging in size from 0.5 mm to 5–6 mm. Many of the fl owers were solitary although some were borne in dense infl orescences ( Friis et al. , 2003 ; Endress and Doyle, 2009 ). ● Both unisexual and bisexual fl owers are apparent in the earliest fossil records, which is in contrast to the late Cretaceous when the majority of fl owers were bisexual ( Friis et al. , 2006 ). ● Many of the earliest fossil fl owers were simple and un-showy in that they lacked petals or sepals ( Figure 6.3 , 6.4 ). ● When present, the sepals, petals, and stamens in the earliest fossil fl owers were borne on the receptacle beneath the ovary (hypogynous). ● Th ere was a large diversity in the size and number of stamens in the earliest fossil fl owers and many had large anthers relative to the stamens ( Figure 6.4 ). Fruits and seeds Earliest evidence for fossil angiosperm fruits dates back to the Aptian and Albian (~125–100 Ma), with examples from localities in Asia and North America, including 06-WillisandMcElwain-Chap06.indd 18806-WillisandMcElwain-Chap06.indd 188 11/28/13 2:20 PM11/28/13 2:20 PM 189 6.1 EVIDENCE FOR THE FIRST ANGIOSPERMS fruits of ceratophyllales ( Dilcher, 1989 ) and ranunculids ( Friis et al. , 1995 ). Many of these early seeds were small (0.1 mm 3 to about 10 mm 3 ( Eriksson et al. , 2000 ), with a hard outer seed coat and one seed per carpel ( Friis et al. , 2010 ). Comparison of seed sizes in extant fl oral groups with the early fossil records has led to the suggestion that these early angiosperms had a ‘weedy’ stature compared with gymnosperm seed plants in the same communities ( Tiff ney, 1984 , 2004 ; Feild et al. , 2004 ). In extant plants, small propagules with thin seed walls and little storage material are associated with early suc- cessional plants that can be classifi ed as ‘r’ strategists (weedy generalists) ( Wing and Boucher, 1998 ). Some of these early seeds also possessed a fl eshy outer layer, indicating either drupes or berries, but their small size suggests that whole infructescenses would probably have been needed to attract animal dispersers ( Friis et al. , 2010 ). It has been suggested that the signifi cantly smaller seed size in angiosperms compared with con- temporaneous gymnosperms indicates strong diff erences in the ecology of dispersal and seedling establishment ( Traverse, 2004 ).

In the majority of angiosperms the pollen wall is di- vided into an outer layer (the tectum) supported on numerous short, radial structures (look- ing like columns and oft en referred to as columellae), which provide an extensive chamber system for the deposition of biologically active substances that act as ‘recognition substances’ on reaching the stigma ( Traverse, 1988b ; Hughes, 1994 ) ( Figure 6.5 ). Th is has allowed for the Figure 6.5 (a) Distinguishing characteristics of fossil angiosperm pollen referred to as columellate.

Th e chemical signal responsible in part for the preven- tion of self-fertilization is found within the tectum ( Ingrouille and Chase, 2004 ). Another remarkable innovation of angiosperms compared with their gymnosperm ancestors was to greatly accelerate the time taken between pollination and fertilization by many orders of magnitude which increased reproductive success ( Figure 6.5 b) ( Williams, 2008 ). Th e earliest unequivocal fossil angiosperm pollen has been found in late Valanginian (~139 million years ago) deposits of Israel ( Brenner, 1996 ), Morocco ( Gubeli et al. , 1984 ), and UK ( Hughes, 1994 ). All the earliest angiosperm pollen grains are small, between ~10–30 microns in diameter, and have a single opening in the pollen wall for pollen tube germina- tion (monoapertuate) ( Hughes, 1994 ; Brenner, 1996 ; Figure 6.6 ). Th is type of pollen is found in a number of extant monocots and ‘magnoliid dicots’ ( Doyle, 2012 ). Th e next pollen appar- ent in the fossil record from approximately 112 Ma is tricolpate, i.e. with three germination furrows at equidistance around the grain ( Figure 6.7 ). Th is pollen is found in extant Eudicots and the presence of this pollen in the fossil record is oft en taken to be indicative of the evolu- tion of the Eudicot lineage. Evolution of three furrows is thought to be an adaptation that facilitated germination on a stigmatic surface ( Endress, 1987 ), as any orientation of a tricol- pate grain would result in at least one germination furrow being positioned near or on the surface of the stigma. Around 100 Ma, tricolporate pollen (three furrows with pores) became apparent in fossil records (which is the most common type of pollen in extant Eudicots) ( Doyle, 2012 ), and fi nally from around 95 Ma tripollenites pollen was also occurring in fossil sequences. Th is fi nal pollen type is usually found in extant wind-pollinated groups such as the Fagales. Th is increasing pattern of diversity in terms of arrangement of pores and furrows was also matched by a change in pollen wall structure, with the earliest walls demonstrating a continuous reticulum moving on to reticulate pollen walls (semitectate) and then patterned walls including transverse striations ( Figure 6.8 ). Th ese changes in pollen wall structure and arrangement of pores and furrows are seen throughout the world ranging from eastern North America (e.g. Doyle and Hickey, 1976 ; Doyle and Robbins, 1977 ) and UK ( Hughes, 1994 ) to Egypt ( Penny, 1989 ) and Equatorial Africa ( Doyle and Le Th omas, 1997 ) and are Figure 6.6 Two morphological types identiﬁ ed in the earliest fossil angiosperm pollen: (a) Clavatipollenites ; (b) Liliacidites .

A number of associations have been made between the early fossil angiosperm pollen and extant types. Th e fossil grains of Clavatipollenites ( Figure 6.6 a), for example, apparently bear a close morphological resemblance to pollen of the extant family Chloranthaceae ( Traverse, 1988b ; Friis et al. , 2006 ). Clavatipollenites has also been found within fossil fl owers identifi ed as members of the Chloranthaceae family, supporting the suggestion that it is associated with this family ( Crane et al. , 1995 ; Friis et al. , 2006 ). Th ose in the Liliacidites group, in comparison, have an outer layer (the sexine) that is similar in structure to that of extant monocotyledons such as Liliaceae ( Brenner, 1996 ). Leaves Angiosperm leaves are megaphyllous in origin. Distinguishing characteristics that aid fossil identifi cation include reticulate venation, forming areoles on all of the major lineages with the exception of monocots, together with veins that end blind within the areoles, and parallel major veins arranged in sets of various sizes and interconnected by smaller veins on the lamina Figure 6.7 Fossil Tricolpites pollen, equatorial and transverse view.

In monocots, the leaf is usually diff erentiated into a blade and sheath, whereas in most other angiosperms the leaf is usually diff erentiated into a blade and petiole ( Figure 6.9 a). Angiosperm leaves are fi rst observed in the fossil record from approximately 125 million years ago (Aptian). Fossil localities range from central Asia, the Russian far-east, Portugal, and the United States ( Hughes, 1994 ; Doyle and Hickey, 1976 ; Hickey and Doyle, 1977 ) and indicate broadly similar assemblages containing small leaves (approximately 2–4 cm in diam- eter) that are simple with unusually low vein densities ( Figure 6.9 b). Over the next 25 million years, the shape and structure of leaves in the fossil record indicates increasing morphological complexity in terms of leaf margin, venation pattern, and size such that by the Cenomanian (~100–93 Ma), palmately lobed and pinnately dissected leaves similar to the extant angio- sperm family Platanus (sycamore) are found ( Figure 6.8 ) ( Crane et al. , 1993 ; Doyle, 2012 ). Changes in structure and diversity of angiosperm leaves in the fossil record indicate a pat- tern of morphological diversifi cation through time that is comparable to that seen in the pollen record ( Doyle, 2012 ; Figure 6.8 ). Attempts to characterize these earliest leaf types and com- pare them with extant leaves and their associated environmental conditions (based on features such as presence/absence of drip-tips, entire or dissected margins, size of leaf blade) has led to Figure 6.9 (a) Extant angiosperm leaves: distinguishing characteristics include (i) reticulate venation forming areoles on Eudicot leaves, together with veins that end blind within the areoles; and (ii) parallel major veins arranged in sets of various sizes and interconnected by smaller veins on the lamina of monocotyledons ( Friis et al. , 1987 ; Stewart and Rothwell, 1993 ).

In comparison, fossil leaves present in younger assemblages of Albian age (~113–100 Ma) possessed features characteristic of extant early successional plants, namely pinnately compound leaves, palmately lobed leaves, and shallow cordate leaves with serrated margins and palmate venation ( Figure 6.8 , 6.10 ) ( Hickey and Doyle, 1977 ; Taylor and Hickey, 1990 ; Doyle, 2012 ). Leaves present in deposits of Cenomanian age (~100–93 Ma) included leaf physiognomies (shape and size) that in extant species are typical of late successional plants. Th ese marked changes in angiosperm leaf physiognomy spanning the latter part of the early Cretaceous has led to the suggestion that although angiosperms were initially early successional plants, within a matter of 20 million years they had formed the canopy of late successional forests ( Doyle and Hickey, 1976 ; Feild et al. , 2011 ). By the Cretaceous-Paleogene transition (66 Ma) angiosperm dominated vegetation had probably acquired the capacity to alter local and regional scale climate as angiosperm leaf vein densities achieved those observed today in modern megathermal rainforests ( Boyce et al. , 2009 ; Feild et al. , 2011 ) ( Figure 6.10 ).

In particular, vein density increased several-fold leading to markedly higher capacity to conduct water throughout the leaf (tran- spiration) and at the same time uptake CO 2 (photosynthesis) at higher rates than previously possible among Mesozoic gymnosperms ( Feild et al. , 2011 ). Th e increased transpiration and photosynthetic capacity of angiosperm leaves, which was driven by greatly increasing vein density, is thought to have positively contributed to the ecological success of angiosperms by the Late Cretaceous ( Feild et al. , 2011 ). It has even been suggested that increased vein density in angiosperm leaves resulted in the evolution of tropical precipitation regimes by increasing the amount of water recycled through the vegetation ( Boyce et al. , 2009 ; Boyce and Lee, 2010 ). 6.2 Nature and distribution of the earliest angiosperms Trees, shrubs, or herbs? Various lines of evidence from the fossil record, including fossil fl owers, fruits, leaves, pollen, and also wood, suggest that by 100 million years ago (Cenomanian) there was an increasing diversity of angiosperms in the global fl ora ( Table 6.3 ). Th ere is some diffi culty, however, based Table 6.3 A comparison of minimum divergence ages of angiosperm lineages based on the oldest known fossil occurrence of the taxon from Magallón et al.

Many of the earliest fossil families (i.e. Chlo- ranthaceae, Piperaceae, Platanaceae, Magnoliaceae, Degeneriaceae, and Winteraceae) have both arborescent and non-arborescent extant forms. Other important early fossil fi nds, such as species within the fossil family Archaefructaceae, were most likely aquatic ( Sun et al. , 1998 , 2002 ). Hence, many competing hypotheses on the likely vegetative morphology of ancestral angiosperms have been proposed. Th ese fall broadly into four schools of thought. Accord- ing to the fi rst, the earliest angiosperms were arborescent shrubs or small trees ( Arber and Parkin, 1907 ). Th e second suggests that they were herbaceous and rhizomatous in habit, such as in extant Chloranthaceae or Piperaceae ( Taylor and Hickey, 1996 ). A third intermediate 06-WillisandMcElwain-Chap06.indd 19706-WillisandMcElwain-Chap06.indd 197 11/28/13 2:20 PM11/28/13 2:20 PM 198 6 FLOWERING PLANT ORIGINS hypothesis suggests that they were most probably herbaceous, weedy, small shrubs ( Stebbins, 1974 ; Crane, 1987 ; Wing and Tiff ney, 1987 ). A fourth hypothesis is that the earliest angio- sperms were aquatic (e.g. Friis et al. , 2001 ; Soltis et al. , 2008 ). Herbaceous or aquatic? Evidence from the fossil and molecular record mainly appears to support the third and fourth hypotheses (i.e. they were herbaceous in habit or aquatics), although there is still much debate around this topic. In terms of the fossil evidence, angiosperm wood is rare in the early Cretaceous fossil record compared with that of gymnosperm wood, and it is not until the late Cretaceous (~70 Ma) that a diverse angiosperm wood fl ora is apparent ( Wing and Tiff ney, 1987 ; Wheeler and Baas, 1993 ; Wing et al. , 1993 ; Friis et al. , 2011 ). Most of the specimens of early Cretaceous angiosperm wood are also extremely small (<10 cm in diameter) ( Herendeen, 1991 ). It is generally assumed, therefore, that this lack of angio- sperm fossil wood is a refl ection of the herbaceous nature of the earliest angiosperms. Th is assumption is further supported by the fact that, in the fossil record, the earliest angiosperm seeds tend to be small (1–40 mm in length) with thin seed walls, and the leaves were small (2–4 cm in diameter) with expanded laminae and reticulate venation. All of these charac- teristics in extant plants are usually indicative of small, weedy plants with a rapid life cycle; possibly riparian weeds ( Doyle and Hickey, 1976 ; Taylor and Hickey, 1996 ; Wing and Boucher, 1998 ; Friis et al. , 1999 ). Th is evidence therefore appears to also support an herba- ceous hypothesis. However, molecular phylogenetic analysis, based on evidence from mi- tochondrial, plastid, and nuclear DNA in extant plants, has identifi ed Amborella , a small woody shrub, as the basal branch of the angiosperm evolutionary tree ( Qiu et al. , 1999 ; Soltis et al. , 2008 ; Magallón, 2009 ; Doyle, 2012 ). Extant Amborella is a genus of rare understory shrubs or small trees that are endemic to the island of New Caledonia. Th e important feature of this genus (and also the second most basal group Austrobaileyales) is that extant plants in these two lineages lack true vessel elements in their wood ( Table 6.1 ). Th is has prompted the suggestion that the earliest angiosperms were understory shrubs that required lower transpi- ration because they grew in dark and disturbed habitats ( Feild et al. , 2003 ; Feild et al. , 2004 ; Soltis et al. , 2009 ). Some of the earliest fossil leaves from the Potomac formations (i.e. terres- trial rather than aquatic) in North America also indicate stomatal patterns similar to those in extant Amborella and Austrobaileyales ( Upchurch, 1984 ; Doyle, 2012 ). Th ese fossil and extant fi ndings therefore support the intermediate hypothesis, that the earliest angiosperms were herbaceous, weedy, small shrubs. Th ere is also a considerable body of evidence to support the suggestion that the earliest an- giosperms were aquatic. Th e next most basal group identifi ed by the molecular phylogenetic studies are Nymphaeales, which are aquatic rhizomatous herbs ( Qiu et al. , 1999 ; Soltis et al. , 2008 ; Magallón, 2009 ; Doyle, 2012 ; Figure 6.25 ). A number of the earliest fossil angiosperms support this distinction including fossil evidence of water lilies in the Early Cretaceous in North America ( Friis et al. , 2001 ) and the fact that one of the earliest known angiosperm fossil plants Archaefrutctus ( Sun et al. , 2002 ; Figure 6.3 , 6.4 ) was also probably aquatic ( Friis et al. , 2003 ; Soltis et al. , 2008 ). Th ere are also a number of early fossil plants demonstrating aquatic traits (reviewed in Doyle, 2012 ) including fossil Nymphaealean leaves found in lower Creta- ceous deposits from Jordan ( Taylor and Brenner, 2008 ). If the earliest ancestral angiosperms had an aquatic habit, this would provide some explanation for why the fi rst appearances of 06-WillisandMcElwain-Chap06.indd 19806-WillisandMcElwain-Chap06.indd 198 11/28/13 2:20 PM11/28/13 2:20 PM 199 6.2 NATURE AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE EARLIEST ANGIOSPERMS unequivocal angiosperms in the fossil record lags (<140 Ma) so far behind the inferred data for their origin based on molecular clocks (between 217 and 275 Ma); taphonomy studies have shown that aquatic plants have a very low preservation potential ( Chapter 1 ). Place of origin and rate of radiation Th ere is much discussion in the literature on where exactly angiosperms originated. Cur- rently, the most favoured hypothesis suggests that angiosperms originated in the palaeotrop- ics (0–30°), radiating out to colonize higher-latitude environments some 20 to 30 million years later ( Hickey and Doyle, 1977 ; Crane and Lidgard, 1989 ; Drinnan and Crane, 1990 ; Hughes, 1994 ; Lupia et al. , 1999 ; Barrett and Willis, 2001 ; Heimhofer et al. , 2005 ). Th is hy- pothesis is based on the evidence in both the fossil pollen record (reviewed in Heimhofer et al. , 2005 ) ( Figure 6.11 ) and the fossil wood record ( Peralta-Medina and Falcon-Lang, 2012 ) ( Figure 6.12 ). Th e earliest well-dated angiosperm pollen has been found in late Val- anginian (~135 Ma) fossil localities in Israel ( Brenner, 1996 ), southern England ( Hughes and McDougall, 1990 ), and Morocco ( Gübeli et al. , 1984 ). During the early Cretaceous these regions lay between the palaeoequator and 25 °N ( Smith and Littlewood, 1994 ) ( Figure 6.11 a). Angiosperms then appear to have spread relatively rapidly into the higher latitudes, with evidence for slightly younger (Hauterivian, ~132 Ma) pollen grains from fossil locali- ties in England ( Hughes and McDougall, 1987 , 1994 ) and China ( Li and Liu, 1994 ). By the Barremian (~127 Ma), angiosperms appear to have been widespread, with fossil localities in central Africa, Australia, Europe, and China ( Barrett and Willis, 2001 , and references cited therein). Evidence from fossil angiosperm wood indicates a similar low latitude origin with initial proliferation of angiosperm wood in the humid tropical and paratropical belt ( Figure 6.12 ). It is interesting to note, however, that although pollen for the early angio- sperms became abundant between 112–90 Ma ( Heimhofer et al. , 2005 ), evidence for fossil wood and development of angiosperm-dominated forests did not become apparent until 25 million years later ( Peralta-Medina and Falcon-Lang, 2012 ). Th is lends further support to the hypothesis that the early angiosperms were probably weedy herbaceous plants and that evolution into woody forms occurred later. A rise in angiosperm-dominated forests is thought to have occurred during the large-scale diversifi cation of angiosperm clades appar- ent between 108–91 Ma that is discussed later in this section ( Wang et al. , 2009 ). Although angiosperms appear to have spread relatively quickly, they did not be- come fl oristically prominent in the low palaeolatitudes (between ~30 °N and 30 °S) until the Aptian (~120 Ma), and in higher palaeolatitudes (between 40 and 65 °S) until the Cenomanian (~100 Ma) ( Crane and Lidgard, 1989 ; Drinnan and Crane, 1990 ; Lidgard and Crane, 1990 ) ( Figure 6.11 ). Diff erences in both diversity and abundance between the low and high latitudes persisted for at least another 30 million years. In the Maastrichtian (~70 Ma), for example, angiosperms dominated low latitude pollen assemblages, accounting for 60–80 per cent of pollen, whereas in the high latitudes, they accounted for only between 30 and 50 per cent of the total pollen ( Crane, 1987 ). Th e remaining percentage of pollen and wood ( Peralta-Medina and Falcon-Lang, 2012 ) in high-latitude fl oras was made up of gymnosperms and pteridophytes ( Figure 6.12 ). Th e apparent rarity of early angiosperms in high-latitude environments is thought to be due, in part, to limitations of light and tempera- ture for a substantial part of the year. Such environmental conditions would have off ered 06-WillisandMcElwain-Chap06.indd 19906-WillisandMcElwain-Chap06.indd 199 11/28/13 2:20 PM11/28/13 2:20 PM 200 6 FLOWERING PLANT ORIGINS Figure 6.11 (a) Global distribution of earliest angiosperm occurrences (pre-Aptian, <121 Ma) recorded in the fossil pollen record, plotted onto a palaeogeographical map of age 135 Ma (Valaginian).

Angiosperm diversity and abundance in the high latitudes increased slowly through the early and mid-Cretaceous, most probably as a function of their biology rather than due to slow migration rates ( Wing and Boucher, 1998 ). Even today in the tundra and boreal bi- omes of the high-latitude regions of North America and Eurasia, for example, angiosperms are of relatively low abundance compared to gymnosperms, in particular the conifers ( Nikolov and Helmisaari, 1992 ; Sirois, 1992 ). For some later angiosperm groups, however, the high latitudes appear to have also been centres of origin. Southern Gondwana, in par- ticular, appears to have been a centre of origin for Nothofagus ( Dettmann and Jarzen, 1990 ; Figure 6.12 (a) Palaeogeographic distribution of Cretaceous angiosperms.

Nothofagus is pres- ently an important element of the southern hemisphere fl ora and, according to the fossil record of this genus, evolved in southern high latitudes during the Maastrichtian (~70 Ma) ( Hill and Scriven, 1995 ). Increasingly the evidence for angiosperm evolution indicates a rapid interval of radia- tion occurring over a period of <15 Ma and possibly as quickly as 5 Ma ( Soltis et al. , 2008 ; Wang et al. , 2009 ; Friis et al. , 2010 ) between ~108–91 Ma. Molecular and fossil evidence indicates that many angiosperm clades diverged rapidly across this interval of time ( Soltis et al. , 2008 ; Wang et al. , 2009 ). Ferns diversifi ed rapidly at the same time (Schneider et al ., 2004) as well as a number of animal groups including major ant lineages ( Moreau et al. , 2006 ) and leaf-beetles ( Wilf et al. , 2000 ). In the angiosperms probably one of the most important clades to diversify was the Rosid clade, which contains approximately 25 per cent of all extant angiosperm species including a number of tropical and temperate trees ( Wang et al. , 2009 ). It is noteworthy that according to both proxy data ( Glasspool and Scott, 2010 ) and model esti- mates ( Bergman et al. , 2004 ) this interval of explosive angiosperm radiation is characterized by the highest atmospheric oxygen levels in Earth history. Th is is supported by an abundance of charcoalifi ed fl owers indicating unusually frequent wildfi re events due to high atmos- pheric O 2 levels. It was also a time of high volcanic activity and fl uctuating atmospheric CO 2 ( Barclay et al. , 2010 ). It is likely therefore that environmental and atmospheric upheaval during this interval was a strong selective force driving angiosperm radiation ( Figure 6.13 ). 6.3 Why so late? Even though angiosperms were present from as early 139 Ma (Valanginian), in plant evo- lutionary terms this is late, occurring 330 million years later than the fi rst land plants. Th e enigma of angiosperm origins and their late arrival in the fossil record has long been an area of palaeobotanical interest and research ( Hughes, 1994 ). Th e factors that then resulted in rapid diversifi cation of the angiosperms within a short time-scale are also of considerable interest ( Friis et al. , 2005 ; Soltis et al. , 2008 ; Wang et al. , 2009 ) and this has led to a number of hypotheses as to why they appear so late in the fossil record. Th ese include bias in the fossil record (that they evolved much earlier but went undetected), and the suggestion that their evolution was triggered by a particular set of environmental conditions and/or biotic interactions (such as co-evolution with animal groups). A broad overview of these diff erent hypotheses will be considered in this section. Nature of the fossil evidence One commonly cited explanation for the late appearance of angiosperms is that it is due to poor preservation of the earliest angiosperm vegetative or reproductive parts. Th us, it is argued that angiosperms may have been part of the global vegetation much earlier than the Cretaceous but were situated in environments where preservation potential would have been poor ( Axelrod, 1952 ; Taylor and Taylor, 1993 ). Some evidence for a pre-Cretaceous origin of angiosperms has been found to support this, although the strength of this evidence is still widely debated as follows: 06-WillisandMcElwain-Chap06.indd 20206-WillisandMcElwain-Chap06.indd 202 11/28/13 2:21 PM11/28/13 2:21 PM 203 6.3 WHY SO LATE? i) Pollen: Angiosperm-like pollen, recognized by a tectate pollen wall, has been found in deposits dating as far back as the Triassic (~220 Ma) and includes several species of grains with a single furrow that have been classifi ed loosely in the Crinopolles group ( Traverse, 1988b ; Cornet, 1989 ; Hochuli et al. , 1989 ; Hochuli and Feist-Burkhardt, 2004 ). However, many discount this evidence since this early ‘pollen’ has never been found within angio- sperm fl owers or other macrofossils to clarify the true nature of these fossil grains ( Friis et al. , 2005 ). In addition, other morphologically similar types of early pollen, originally classifi ed as angiosperm-like, have since been demonstrated to belong to earlier groups (i.e. gymno- sperms or pteridophytes), or be contained in deposits that were stratigraphically misplaced and much younger than originally thought ( Hughes, 1994 ). ii) Macrofossil evidence: Some macrofossils were originally thought to date back to a pre-Cretaceous age including the widely-cited angiosperm fruiting axes Archaefructus liaoningensis and some angiosperm leaves. Th e Archaefructus liaoningensis fossil, extracted from the lower part of the Yixian Formation of the Liaoning Province, China, was originally dated as late Jurassic based on biostratigraphical correlation (~145 Ma) ( Sun et al. , 1998 ). Th ere has been much debate about the age of the formation. More recent dating of the de- posits, including radiometric dating ( 40 Ar– 39 Ar) and palaeontological evidence, now sug- gests that the lower part of the Yixian Formation is of late early Cretaceous age (~125 Ma) ( Luo, 1999 ; Swisher et al. , 1999 ; Barrett, 2000 ), casting some doubts on the claim that this is the fi rst unequivocal pre-Cretaceous angiosperm megafossil.

Th is leaf appears to have a typical angiosperm-like venation pattern ( Stewart and Rothwell, 1993 ). However, Furcula leaves also display forking laminae ( Figure 6.14 ), which are much more common in certain pteridosperms ( Harris, 1932 ; Stewart and Rothwell, 1993 ). Th e classifi cation of this leaf type as angiospermous therefore remains ambiguous, and from the fossil evidence alone (pollen, fruiting axes, and leaves) there is a justifi able scepticism concerning the pre- Cretaceous occurrence of angiosperms ( Crane et al. , 1995 ). iii) Molecular evidence: Results from molecular clocks provide some of the most con- vincing evidence for a pre-Cretaceous origin for angiosperms. Estimates to determine the date for the origin of the angiosperm crown group using the divergences apparent in DNA sequences suggest that this event may have occurred sometime in the early Permian to late Jurassic (275–221 Ma) ( Magallón, 2009 ) ( Figure 6.15 ); a similar early origination age of between 228–217 Ma was obtained from molecular dating by Smith et al. ( 2010 ) . Th us, by inference, these studies suggest that angiosperm origins must have occurred much earlier in plant evolutionary history. As with all molecular dating, however, a note of caution must be added since these dates vary considerably depending upon the diff erent methods (molecu- lar clocks, Bayesian probability distributions etc.) used to calculate the ages from molecular phylogenetic trees ( see Doyle, 2012 ) and other estimates indicate a somewhat younger age, e.g. 183–147 Ma (early to late Jurassic) ( Bell et al. , 2010 ). Whatever the method used, how- ever, all records (fossil and molecular) still point to a relatively late evolutionary arrival of the angiosperms relative to other seed plant groups; a point fi rst noted by Darwin in 1859 and referred to as ‘an abominable mystery’ ( Soltis et al. , 2008 ). Figure 6.14 Fossil Furcula leaf. The typical angiosperm-like venation pattern seen in this fossil, which has been found in deposits dating back to the late Triassic (~210 Ma), led to the suggestion that this was an early angiosperm and therefore supported a pre-Cretaceous origin of this group.

While there is no clear evidence (as yet) that the diversifi cation and radiation of angiosperms was triggered by these environmental events, a number of fl oristic changes in mid-Cretaceous vegetation do correlate broadly with them ( Lupia et al. , 1999 ; McElwain et al. , 2011 ). It is suggested that these major environmental changes may have conferred competitive advantages to the angiosperms at the expense of the previously dominant gymnosperms and pteridophytes. In particular, the period between 124 and 83 million years ago (Aptian to Campanian) saw a dramatic change in continental confi gurations. Although the supercontinent Pangea had started to break up by the early Jurassic (~200 Ma) ( Erwin, 1993 ), a period of rapid plate spreading was initiated in the Aptian (~124 Ma) until the Cenomanian (~83 Ma) ( Sheridan, 1987 , 1997 ). Closely associated with this change in continental plates was a super plume event around 100 Ma ( Condie, 2004 ). It is estimated that a number of these super plume events have occurred through Earth’s history and, regardless of age, most last for approxi- mately 10 million years ( Abbott and Isley, 2002 ). A super plume event results from increased production rates of new crust and closely ties in with the formation of supercontinents. In a super plume event a single large plume that divides into head and tail components ( Condie, 2001 ) upwells and rises from deep boundary layers in the Earth’s core-mantle 06-WillisandMcElwain-Chap06.indd 20506-WillisandMcElwain-Chap06.indd 205 11/28/13 2:21 PM11/28/13 2:21 PM 206 6 FLOWERING PLANT ORIGINS boundary ( Larson, 1991a , b ). Along with important implications for plate movements in Earth’s history, super plume events are also closely associated with dramatic global climatic and environmental change including sea-level rise and a large increase in atmospheric CO 2 and global temperatures ( Figure 6.16 , 6.17 ). It is estimated that a 100 m rise in long-term eustatic sea level occurred ( Valentine and Moores, 1970 ; Haq et al. , 1987 ; Hallam, 1992 ) around 100 Ma resulting from isostatic uplift and thermal erosion of the oceanic lithosphere above plume heads and seawater displace- ment by oceanic plateaus ( Kerr, 1994 ; Lithgow-Bertelloni and Silver, 1998 ; Condie, 2004 ). Th is resulted in the formation of extensive epicontinental seas covering the interiors of North America, southern Europe, Australia, Africa, and South America ( Briggs, 1995 ; Condie and Sloan, 1998 ). Increased volcanism accompanied the mantle plume activity in the mid Creta- ceous with evidence for two distinct phases of eruption of the Ontong Java plateau between 125 and 119 Ma (Phase 1) and between 94 and 86 Ma (Phase 2). Enhanced volcanic activity resulted in elevated greenhouse gases and temperatures followed by major carbon seques- tration episodes known as oceanic anoxic events, which temporarily decreased atmospheric CO 2 levels ( Kuroda et al. , 2007 ; Barclay et al. , 2010 ). Mid-Cretaceous atmospheric composi- tion is therefore characterized by relatively rapid large-scale fl uctuations in CO 2 between minimum concentrations similar to modern day levels (~400 ppm) and maximum concen- trations above 1500 ppm ( Haworth et al. , 2005 ; Barclay et al. , 2010 ) superimposed on a long Figure 6.16 Estimated variations in atmospheric CO 2 during the past 600 million years based on model predictions ( Berner and Kothavala, 2001 ) and palaeo-proxy estimates (compiled by Royer et al. , 2004 ).

Global average surface temperatures were considerably higher (>10 °C) than present throughout the Cretaceous period ( Frakes et al. , 2005 ; Hay and Floegel, 2012 ) and the timing of most rapid angiosperm radiation between 108 and 91 Ma ( Wang et al. , 2009 ) coincides with maximum global temperatures for the entire period ( Figure 6.17 ). Evidence from various palaeoclimatic indicators also supports the suggestion that this was a time of global climate warmth ( Figure 6.18 ). Coral reefs, for which warm water is essential for sur- vival and growth, increased their ranges as much as 1500 km closer to the poles, and isotopic analysis of deep ocean sediments (δ 18 O) suggests that deep ocean water, presently hovering near freezing, was 15 °C warmer. Th ere is also evidence of high polar warmth with little to no ice during this period of time ( Barron and Washington, 1984 ; Condie and Sloan, 1998 ; Price, 1999 ). Th is is supported by the existence of temperate forests close to the poles ( Spicer and Parrish, 1986 ) ( Figure 6.19 ). During this time there were also signifi cant changes in humidity and a hydrological cycle that was greatly accelerated ( White et al. , 2001 ). But why should environmental change in the Cretaceous promote angiosperm evolution or favour their diversifi cation and radiation? One argument is that the evolution of high vein density in angiosperm leaves and vessels in angiosperm wood provided angiosperms with greatly enhanced capacity to conduct water through the plant body ( Boyce et al. , 2009 ; Feild et al. , 2011 ). Th is in turn enabled angiosperms to boost photosynthetic capacity ( Brodribb and Feild, 2009 ) and meet the demand of increasing transpiration as atmospheric CO 2 declined through the Cretaceous. It is also likely that enhanced transpiration capacity of Figure 6.17 A comparison of Cretaceous and modern climate showing global average temperature trends through the Cretaceous compared with present and Last Glacial Maximum (18,000 years ago) global temperatures from Frakes ( 1999 ) and Francis and Frakes ( 1993 ) .

Th is would have contributed to the development of a humid tropical everwet climate at low equatorial latitudes, which (based on palaeoclimate proxies) is evident for the fi rst time in the Cenomanian ( Figure 6.19 ). Th us, there was a massive shift in the global vegetation resulting from a positive feedback between angiosperms and their environment and leading to their global dominance ( Berendse and Scheff er, 2009 ). An alternative explanation is that the environmental instability triggered by super plume activity and volcanism during the mid-Cretaceous was responsible for a dramatic increase in polyploidy events apparent in angiosperms at ~100 Ma ( Soltis et al. , 2009 ). Th is led to accelerated speciation rates and to an overwhelming diversity of adaptive types of angio- sperms, which then outcompeted the existing gymnosperm and spore producing lineages ( Lupia et al. , 1999 ; Soltis et al. 2009 ). Th is is discussed further in Chapter 9 . Biotic interactions Dinosaur–angiosperm co-evolution Another hypothesis proposed for the late appearance of the angiosperms is that their evolu- tion was closely associated with the large-scale radiation of certain groups of tetrapods, and that dinosaur feeding behaviour promoted the evolution of fl owering plants ( Bakker, 1978 , 06-WillisandMcElwain-Chap06.indd 20806-WillisandMcElwain-Chap06.indd 208 11/28/13 2:21 PM11/28/13 2:21 PM 209 6.3 WHY SO LATE? 1986 ). Th is hypothesis is based on apparent evidence in the fossil record to suggest that a change in herbivore communities from high to low browsers occurred at approximately the same time as the initial evolution and radiation of angiosperms. Dinosaur fossil evidence suggests, for example, that approximately 160 million years ago, in the late Jurassic, 95 per cent of the preserved biomass of dinosaurs was made up of sauropods and stegosaurs ( Figure 6.20 ). Th ese were high-browsing herbivores with a diversity of cranial and den- tal adaptations indicating a diet of a wide range of conifer tissue. It is argued that these high-browsing forms would have put intense pressure on the canopies of the mature trees, but permitted the development of gymnosperm saplings. However, from approximately 144 million years ago (Jurassic/Cretaceous boundary) the herbivore communities changed considerably and new groups of big, low-browsing ornithischian dinosaurs ( Figure 6.20 ) ap- peared in the fossil record. It is suggested that these intense low-browsing dinosaurs would have increased mortality among the gymnosperm seedlings and thinned out the forest structure, thus creating gaps in the canopy and highly disturbed environments ( Bakker, 1978 , 1986 ). Early angiosperm traits, such as small structure, rapid life cycle, and high colonizing ability, would have given them the competitive advantage on these disturbed substrates, thereby promoting their radiation ( Bakker, 1978 ; Wing and Tiff ney, 1987 ). Additional work on plant–herbivore interactions adds further detail in suggesting that it was the mechanics of chewing among herbivores that could have aided angiosperm evolu- tion during the Cretaceous. In particular, the radiation of ornithischian dinosaurs between 160–120 million years ago (mid-Jurassic–mid-Cretaceous) may have played an important role, since these were the fi rst group of herbivores to develop a transverse chewing motion (which ground the food before passing it into the gut), thereby enabling these animals to exploit more fully the newly evolving plant resource ( Weishampel and Norman, 1989 ). Th ere is also some evidence to indicate dinosaurs consuming angiosperm material, includ- ing, for example, angiosperm fruit, which has been found in the gut of an early Cretaceous ankylosaur, Minmi ( Molnar and Cliff ord, 2000 ). However, an increasing body of work comparing the timing and location of the evolu- tion of angiosperms with major events in the evolution of dinosaur herbivory has rejected this hypothesis for a number of reasons ( Barrett and Willis, 2001 ; Lloyd et al. , 2008 ; Butler et al. , 2009 ). First, the fact that angiosperms did not comprise a signifi cant proportion of the global fl ora until the late Cretaceous, as evidenced in fossil records of pollen, macrofos- sils ( Butler et al. , 2009 ), and wood ( Peralta-Medina and Falcon-Lang, 2012 ), suggests that it is highly unlikely that they formed a major constituent of dinosaur diets during the early Cretaceous ( Barrett and Willis, 2001 ; Butler et al. , 2009 ). Secondly, detailed examination of the timing of dinosaur evolution suggests that no major event in the evolution of herbivo- rous dinosaurs can be correlated with angiosperm origins. Innovations in chewing and the onset of factors such as low browsing, for example, either precede or post-date the appear- ance of the fi rst angiosperms in the fossil record (for a review see Butler et al. , 2009 ). In ad- dition, changes in dinosaur browsing behaviour at the Jurassic– Cretaceous boundary may not have been so marked as previously suggested. Th irdly, fossil evidence currently available suggests that there was no spatial overlap between the earliest angiosperms and diversifi - cation of major clades of herbivorous dinosaurs. Most early Cretaceous dinosaur localities, for example, were situated at palaeolatitudes higher than 30°N and 30°S, with only around 10 per cent of the total number within 20° of the palaeoequator, where the earliest 06-WillisandMcElwain-Chap06.indd 20906-WillisandMcElwain-Chap06.indd 209 11/28/13 2:21 PM11/28/13 2:21 PM 210 6 FLOWERING PLANT ORIGINS ?3 2 6 5 7 3 5 4 2 6 1 Figure 6.19 Continues 06-WillisandMcElwain-Chap06.indd 21006-WillisandMcElwain-Chap06.indd 210 11/28/13 2:21 PM11/28/13 2:21 PM 211 6.3 WHY SO LATE? moderately thermophilic vegetaiton high-latitude temperate belts (= cool temperate biome) mid-latitude warm humid belts (= warm temperate biome) evaporite belts (= desert biome) arid zone (= tropical summerwet biome) humid zone (= tropical everwet biome) external (facing the poles) boundaries of main Equatorial (E) and Euro-Sinian (ES) zones boundaries of climatic belts hypothetical boundaries of climatic belts outline of present land areas coastline for stage under consideration moderately thermophilic vegetaiton moderately thermophilic insects thermophilic insects thermophilic vegetation abundant (>50%) content of Classopollis pollen low (<50%) content of Classopollis pollen localities of dinosaur remains coal and lignite deposits sedimentological proxies sedimentary and laterite bauxites quartz–kaolin sediments kaolin weathering crust or deposits laterite and clastic iron ores of terrestrial origin coastal-marine and oolitic iron ores gypsum and anhydrite deposits rock, potassium and other salts oceanic carbonate platforms carbonate platforms and shelves pelagic calcareous sediments pelagic siliceous sediments glacial deposits angiosperms with entire narrow leaves mountainous marginal and island volcanic belts palaeobiological proxies 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Figure 6.19 Changes in climate zone through the Cretaceous as inferred from palaeobiological and sedimentological proxies from Chumakov et al.

In addition, major diversifi cation of di- nosaurs in the late Cretaceous is now thought to be a sampling bias rather than a real evolutionary trend ( Lloyd et al. , 2008 ). Lastly, but perhaps most importantly, detailed in- vestigation of the sauropod diet and biology suggests that these huge organisms were capa- ble of both high and low browsing behaviour and that the nutritional value of low browse food sources such as sphenopsids (e.g. Equisetum ) and ferns (e.g. Angiopteris ) equals that of typical high browse angiosperm and gymnosperm trees ( Hummel et al. , 2008 ; Klein et al. , 2011 ) ( Figure 6.21 ). Insect–angiosperm co-evolution Another proposed biotic interaction of importance is that of angiosperm–insect co-evolu- tion. Early and mid-Cretaceous fl owers contained many features to suggest that they were insect pollinated, including stamens with small anthers, low pollen production, and pollen grains oft en covered with pollenkitt-like material, and they were larger than the most eff ec- tive size for wind dispersal ( Crepet and Friis, 1987 ; Crane et al. , 1995 ). Th ere are a number of diagnostic features in extant pollen that are indicative of insect pollinated (zoophily) versus wind-pollinated (anemophily) pollen ( Table 6.4 ). Occurrence of these features combined with evidence for clumped pollen (probably representing the sticky nature of the pollen, Figure 6.20 Stratigraphic record of herbivorous dinosaurs through the late Jurassic/early Cretaceous. It is proposed that the transition from high-browsing forms to low browsers in the early Cretaceous resulted in increased mortality among the gymnosperm seedlings and created highly disturbed environments that gave angiosperms a competitive advantage.

When the diff erent modes of pollen transport are mapped against angiosperm lineages, it becomes apparent that the vast majority of the early clades were insect pollinated. Estimates suggest, for example, that up to 86 per cent of extant basal angiosperm families had pollina- tion mechanisms that involved zoophily ( Hu et al. , 2008 ). But why would insect pollination modes favour the diversifi cation and radiation of the angiosperms? Insect pollination would have been highly advantageous to the early angi- osperms, enabling genetic exchange between widely spaced individuals or small popula- tions. Furthermore, the suggestion that self-incompatibility mechanisms were present in the earliest angiosperms makes processes such as insect pollination even more critical for cross- pollination ( Zavada, 1984 ). It is therefore suggested that the late evolution of angiosperms is closely related to that of insect evolution. Fossil, morphological, and molecular evidence for the co-evolution of insect pollinators with angiosperms has been demonstrated for some groups ( Grimaldi and Engel, 2005 ). Th ere is also secondary evidence for their presence including leaf mines and other damage to angiosperm leaves caused by feeding ( Scott et al. , 1992 ; Labandeira et al. , 1994 ; Labandeira, 1998 ; Wilf et al. , 2000 ). However, comparison of the times of appearance of innovations in insect feeding systems with the timing of angiosperm radiation does not indicate a strong relationship ( Labandeira, 1997 ; Ren et al. , 2009 ). Th e advanced pollinator groups, includ- ing some Hymenoptera (certain wasps that are the sister group of the bees) and Lepidoptera (butterfl ies and moths), indicate a certain amount of synchronicity between their fi rst fossil appearance (from approximately 140 million years ago, although molecular evidence oft en Figure 6.21 Graph showing the nutritional value of various high and low browse potential sauropod food sources.

However, other early groups such as Diptera (e.g. crane fl ies and fungus-gnats), Coleoptera (beetles), and some Hymenoptera (e.g. saw- fl ies) have a fossil record indicating that a fi rst appearance pre-dates that of the angiosperms. Th e Mecroptera (scorpion-fl ies), for example, have a fossil record that indicates insects with long tubular proboscides extending as far back as 250–100 Ma ( Ren et al. , 2009 ), i.e. well before angiosperms are thought to have originated. It is suggested that these insects were most probably feeding on ovulate secretions from gymnosperms. In contrast, other groups that are currently important pollinators of angiosperms, including the Apoidea (honeybees), have a fossil record that only extends as far back as the Albian (~100 Ma) and therefore post- dating angiosperm origins. Moreover, in analysis of insect familial-level diversity through time there is no marked increase in insect diversity corresponding with the timing of angio- sperm origin ( Labandeira and Sepkoski, 1993 ) ( Figure 6.23 ). Th ere is increasing evidence to suggest, therefore, that advanced pollinators (wasps, bees, and moths) may have played an important role in the co-evolution and major radiation of certain groups of fl owering plants ( Crepet, 1996 ; Grimaldi, 1999 ), but that the timing of angiosperm evolution as a whole can- not be explained by insect co- evolution alone. 6.4 Evolutionary trends: gymnosperms to angiosperms Over the past 10 years molecular phylogenetics combined with morphological analyses of extant and fossil material has led to an emerging consensus relating to both the origi- nal basal clades and subsequent lineage splits leading to the vast diversity of fl owering plants currently encountered on Earth. Although agreement on the identity of the gym- nosperm group from which angiosperms likely arose is still somewhat of an ‘abominable mystery’, the consensus opinion can be summarized as follows: 1. Despite early suggestions that angiosperms were of a polyphyletic origin (a number of diff erent ancestors), almost all recent evidence (morphological and molecular) suggests that angiosperms were derived from a single common ancestor (that is, they had a monophyletic origin) ( Doyle and Donoghue, 1986 ; Qiu et al. , 1999 , APG III, 2009 ).

Th e ancestral seed plant group to angiosperms is not represented by any living gymno- sperm ( Hilton and Bateman, 2006 ). Instead, extinct pteridosperms (seed ferns) are likely to hold the key to the origin of angiosperms. Two of the earliest suggestions for possible evolu- tionary pathways between gymnosperms and angiosperms were via the Bennettitales ( Arber and Parkin, 1907 , 1908 ) and Gnetales ( Von Wettstein, 1907 ) ( Figure 6.24 ). Th e evidence for Bennettitales ( see Chapter 5 for a description) as one of the earliest angiosperm relatives is still a possibility, although the link to Gnetales ( see Chapter 5 ) is less well supported by current molecular phylogenies ( Doyle, 2010 ). Most phylogenies that include extinct as well as extant seed plant clades place Caytoniales as the closest link ( see Chapter 5 ) between the gymnosperms and angiosperms ( Hilton and Bateman, 2006 ) ( Figure 5.6 ), although there is still some debate around this point (see for example Friis et al. , 2006 ). 3. Th e earliest extant angiosperm clade to evolve was probably Amborella ( Qiu et al. , 1999 ; Magallón, 2009 ; Endress and Doyle, 2009 ), i.e. Amborellaceae is the sister group to all other angiosperms, a group that currently has one species in New Caledonia ( Figure 6.25 ). Molecular phylogenies and fossil evidence indicate that this clade along with Nymphaeaceae and Austrobaileyales (which includes Illiciaceae, Trimeniaceae) form the basal lineages to the angiosperms and they are oft en termed the ANITA grade (named aft er the initial letters for each of these lineages) ( APG, 1998 ). Th is basal clade currently accounts for ~0.1 per cent of extant angiosperms ( Doyle, 2012 ). 4. Th e remaining 99 per cent of angiosperms are now thought to have radiated from fi ve clades known as the ‘core group’ namely Chloranthales, Magnoliidae (a.k.a. Magnoliids, including Magnoliales, Laurales, Canellacea, and Piperales), Monocots, Ceratophyllales, and Eudicots ( Endress and Doyle, 2009 ; Magallón, 2009 ; Doyle, 2012 ) ( Figure 6.25 ). 5. Within the Eudicots there are a number of important early diverging lineages but the overwhelming diversity of species is found in two well resolved clades, the Rosid clade and the Asterid clade, collectively referred to as the core Eudicots ( APG III, 2009 ; Judd et al. , Figure 6.23 Insect familial diversity from the Triassic (~248 Ma) to present plotted on a semi-logarithmic scale. The temporal position of the ﬁ rst appearance of angiosperms in the fossil record, and their subsequent radiation, are also indicated. Redrawn from C.C. Labandeira and J.J.

Core Eudicots are well represented in the fossil record as far back as the Barremian (~121 Ma) ( Forest and Chase, 2009 ). 6.5 Biogeographical distribution of global vegetation during the late Cretaceous (~100–66 Ma) During the late Cretaceous (~100–66 Ma) angiosperms increased in both species num- ber and diversity ( Figure 6.26 ). Angiosperm trees and shrubs evolving during this time included a number of families that constitute a signifi cant part of the present-day global fl ora ( Table 6.3 ). Evidence from the fossil record suggests, for example, that a number of ex- tant northern and southern hemisphere families appeared for the fi rst time. Th ese include Ulmaceae (including evidence for Ulmus ), Betulaceae, Juglandaceae, Fagaceae (especially Nothofagus ), and Gunneraceae ( Table 6.3 ). Th e striking number of angiosperm fossils pre- sent by the late Cretaceous with close affi nities to extant families has led to the suggestion that eventually it will be discovered that all angiosperm families originated during this remarkable period ( Wing and Boucher, 1998 ). Th e majority of trees to appear in the late Cretaceous (~100–66 Ma) have a present-day distribution that is mainly tropical or subtropical ( Figure 6.11 ). It is interesting to note that most present-day angiosperm families are basically tropical in their requirements, with over one-half of angiosperm families confi ned to tropical regions and over three-quarters of all angiosperm families attaining optimum development and diversity in a tropical environment Figure 6.24 Phylogenetic trees showing two early alternative hypotheses for the evolutionary relationships between angiosperms and seed plants: (a) supports the hypothesis that Gnetales are the closest relative of angiosperms; and (b) supports the hypothesis that Bennettitales are the closest relative of angiosperms.

Th erefore, although many may now be classifi ed as northern/ southern temperate species by their distribution, it is probable that they still possess the traits that would enable them to survive in conditions similar to those characteristic of the early envi- ronments where they originated. Detailed ‘biome-level analyses’ of global plant biogeography and palaeoclimate have been carried out for the late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian, ~72–66 Ma) ( Horrell, 1991 ; Upchurch et al. , 1999 ). Seven global biomes are recognized, as follows ( Figure 6.27 ). Cool temperate biome Th e cool temperate biome in the Maastrichtian (72–66 Ma) coincides roughly with the present-day Arctic circle, comprising Canada, Greenland, and Siberia in the northern hemi- sphere and Antarctica in the southern hemisphere ( Horrell, 1991 ). Th e vegetation of the cool temperate biome has also been referred to as polar deciduous forest ( Upchurch et al. , 1999 ) and was clearly one of three remaining biomes in the late Cretaceous not dominated by angiosperms. Instead, vegetation in this region was dominated by deciduous and evergreen conifers with ferns and ginkgos. Angiosperms are believed to have been present as understory and included members of the Betulaceae and Juglandaceae. Th e prevalence of leaf-shedding among the angiosperm species ( Vakhrameev, 1991 ), relative low-diversity fl oras, evidence for growth rings ( Spicer and Parrish, 1990 ), and the presence of some, but not abundant, coals, supports the suggestion of seasonality, typical of a cool temperate climate ( Horrell, 1991 ). Members of the Pinaceae and Taxodiaceae ( Sequoia and Taxodium ) were common conifers, and the fossil record also includes evidence for ‘modern’ genera such as Pinus and Abies . Other conifers, widely spread but less signifi cant in terms of their representation, included Cupressaceae and Araucariaceae. In the southern hemisphere, the cool temperate biome was Figure 6.25 Current understanding of the evolutionary relationships among major angiosperm clades based on the classiﬁ cation of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group ( APG, 1998 , 2003 , 2009 ). The morphological traits that characterize different groups are indicated on the phylogeny. For example, all Eudicots are characterized by the presence of tricolpate pollen (see illustration in Figure 6.9 ).

Th e abundance of Nothofagus pollen has led to the suggestion that the climates of Antarctica and southern Australia were cooler and drier than those of the northern hemisphere lower latitudes ( Herngreen and Chlonovo, 1981 ). Warm temperate biome Th e warm temperate biome between 45° and 65° palaeolatitude encompassed present-day northern North America, southern Greenland, parts of western Europe, Russia, and north- ern China in the northern hemisphere, and Australia and coastal Antarctica in the southern hemisphere ( Horrell, 1991 ). Th e vegetation characteristic of this biome included abundant Eudicot and monocotyledonous angiosperms, evergreen and deciduous conifers, ferns, and cycads. Upchurch et al. ( 1999 ) have referred to the vegetation of this region as ‘sub-tropical broad-leaved evergreen forest and woodland’, as many of the fossil leaf shapes are com- mon among modern subtropical plants. However, due to the palaeolatitudinal position of this region, well outside the subtropics, Horrell’s climatic assessment and interpretation of this region as warm temperate rather than subtropical is used here ( Figure 6.27 ). Common angiosperms included members of the Fagaceae (e.g. Castanea ), Betulaceae (e.g. Betula ), Juglandaceae (e.g. Juglans ), Ulmaceae (e.g. Ulmus , Zelkova ), Proteaceae (southern hemi- sphere only), and Winteraceae among Eudicots and basal non-monocot clades and corphoid palms were abundant monocotyledons. Conifers included Araucariaceae and Taxodiaceae. Th e high diversity of angiosperms in fossil fl oras from this region was thought to indicate their dominance. However, detailed analysis of a fossil fl ora from Wyoming, preserved in situ by an ash fall, has shown that although angiosperms constituted 61 per cent of the total fl oral diver- sity, they accounted for a mere 12 per cent of cover, compared with 49 per cent by ferns ( Wing et al. , 1993 ). It is apparent, therefore, that although angiosperms had reached a dominant position Figure 6.26 Evidence from fossil leaf assemblages (summed genus and species diversity) indicating a major expansion of angiosperm diversity through the Cretaceous period.

Th is study also demonstrates the complexity and mosaic of diff erent habitats that exist within each individual biome, and highlights the impor- tance of taking into account preservational biases when undertaking biogeographical analyses. Winterwet biome Th e vegetation between palaeolatitudes of approximately 30° and 45° was markedly less diverse than that of the warm temperate biome, and is characterized mainly by the occur- rence of evergreen angiosperms together with both evergreen and deciduous conifers with some cycads. A notable feature of the vegetation of this region was the relatively lower abun- dance of monocotyledons. Floras from the winterwet biome indicate the presence of abun- dant Araucaria and cheirolepidaceous conifers, and evidence from fossil wood suggests that angiosperms may have formed part of an understory of both shrubs and small trees rather than large canopy trees ( Upchurch and Wolfe, 1987 ). In the southern hemisphere, Patagonian fl oras contained abundant ferns and angiosperm families such as Lauraceae. Th e presence of huntite, a mineral that today is only formed in warm environments with high rates of evaporation, typical of Mediterranean climates, together with an absence of clear growth rings in fossil woods, provides good support for the designation of a winterwet biome to this region ( Horrell, 1991 ). However, this is not sup- ported unanimously and Upchurch et al. ( 1999 ) suggest that the absence of fossil leaves with spinose margins, which are typical of the modern winterwet biome vegetation, questions whether this biome really existed during the late Cretaceous. It is worth noting, however, that despite the absence of one vegetative characteristic, a number of model simulations of the late Cretaceous climate indicate that a Mediterranean (i.e. ‘winterwet’) climate may indeed have prevailed in certain areas during this time.

It is thought therefore that this biome represents a transition between the arid desert biomes of the lower latitudes and the humid biomes of the higher- latitude temperate belts ( Horrell, 1991 ). Subtropical desert biome Evidence for extensive evaporite deposits during the late Cretaceous (~70 Ma), indicating high rates of evaporation over precipitation, mark the subtropical desert biome ( Horrell, 1991 ). Th ese deposits occur in a northern hemisphere belt that incorporates present-day North Africa, China, and the Yukatan peninsula, and in the southern hemisphere includes present- day south-western Africa and southern South America. No fossil fl oras have yet been found in these biomes, most probably refl ecting both the low diversity and productivity that would have been apparent, but also the low preservation potential of fossil plants in arid environments. Tropical summerwet biome Th e tropical summerwet biome incorporates the majority of present-day Africa, South America, and India, from palaeolatitudes 0° to 25° ( Horrell, 1991 ; Upchurch et al. , 1999 ) and is characterized by a ‘tropical semi-deciduous forest’ type vegetation. Common elements in the vegetation of this region include Eudicots and monocotyledons, ferns, conifers, and cy- cads. Evidence from fossil pollen and wood suggest that common conifers included members of the Araucariaceae, Cheirolepidaceae, and Podocarpaceae. India contained fl oral elements typical of both the southern hemisphere (e.g. Nothofagus , Proteaceae, and Podocarpaceae) and also elements of the northern hemisphere vegetation, leading to the suggestion that by the late Cretaceous, the Indian plate was already part of the equatorial biogeographical re- gion, even though in terms of palaeogeography it was still 30°S ( Briggs, 1995 ). Th e combined evidence from fossil fl oral composition, leaf physiognomy, and sedimentological indicators suggests that this region was characterized by a hot, subhumid to semiarid climate typical of present-day summerwet or savannah regions ( Horrell, 1991 ). Tropical everwet biome Th e tropical everwet biome of the late Cretaceous was much reduced in comparison with the present-day extent of tropical rainforest, and was restricted to an area including present- day subequatorial west Africa and Malaysia ( Horrell, 1991 ) and possibly Somalia in east Africa and Colombia in South America ( Upchurch et al. , 1999 ). Palynological assemblages recovered from these areas suggest that during the late Cretaceous the equatorial region was dominated by species of Arecaceae (palms) ( Vakhrameev, 1991 ), including the extant genus Nypa ( Figure 6.27 ). Other angiosperms present included Proteaceae and many other angiosperm groups, while ferns and tree-ferns were also abundant ( Meyen, 1987 ). A strik- ing feature of this biome is the almost complete absence of evidence for either evergreen or deciduous conifers, with the exception of Araucariaceae in Malaysia. Comparison of the biogeographical patterns present in the late Cretaceous (~70 Ma) with those from the early Carboniferous (~360 Ma), middle Permian (~267 Ma), and early Jurassic 06-WillisandMcElwain-Chap06.indd 22206-WillisandMcElwain-Chap06.indd 222 11/28/13 2:21 PM11/28/13 2:21 PM 223SUMMARY (~196 Ma) reveals a consistent pattern, whereby the tropical everwet biome is either absent or severely restricted in extent. Th is phenomenon has also been observed for the early Cretaceous (~137 Ma) ( Ziegler et al. , 1987 ). In contrast, the extent of the tropical everwet biome during the late Carboniferous (~300 Ma) spans from the equator to approximately 25°, similar to the ob- served extent of this biome today. It is noteworthy that the features common to both the upper Carboniferous and present day are the presence of polar ice caps, high latitudinal temperature gradients, and comparatively low atmospheric CO 2 concentration. It can therefore be suggested that these characteristics may be important global environmental prerequisites to the develop- ment of an extensive ‘tropical rainforest’ biome. Vegetation feedback on the hydrological and climate systems may also be important as modelling of contemporary tropical everwet forests shows that a large proportion of the precipitation in these regions today is driven by plant transpiration ( Boyce and Lee, 2010 ). Th e transpiration rate of angiosperm-dominated vegeta- tion is signifi cantly greater than that of gymnosperm-dominated forests because of higher leaf vein densities ( Feild et al. , 2011 ). Th ere is a distinct possibility, therefore, that the appearance of a tropical everwet biome at the equator in the mid-Cretaceous ( Figure 6.19 ) aft er a 200 mil- lion year absence in Earth history may in part be driven by the high transpiration capacity of a newly evolved vegetation dominated by angiosperms. Summary 1. Th e fi rst fossil evidence for fl owering plants (angiosperms) appeared from approxi- mately 139 Ma (early Cretaceous). Rapid diversifi cation from ~100 Ma led to their global dominance by the early Cenozoic (~66 Ma). 2. Evidence for the fi rst angiosperms includes fossil pollen (earliest appearance: 139 Ma), fl owers (129 Ma), fruits and seeds (125 Ma), and leaves (125 Ma). 3. Th e earliest angiosperms appear to have originated in the palaeotropics (0–30°), radi- ating out to colonize higher latitudes some 20–30 million years later. 4. In evolutionary terms, the angiosperms are the most recent group to appear in the fossil record, approximately 330 million years later than the fi rst land plants, and 230 million years later than the fi rst seed plants. 5. Various hypotheses have been suggested to account for their relatively late appearance in the fossil record, including a bias in the fossil evidence, a particular suite of environ- mental conditions and/or biotic interactions that led to their later evolution. 6. Two biotic interactions that are of particular interest are the co-evolution of fl owering plants with low-browsing dinosaurs and with pollinating insect groups. 7. Th ere is increasing evidence to support the suggestion that the earliest angiosperms were aquatics or of an herbaceous habit. 8. Molecular phylogenies indicate that the earliest extant angiosperm clade to evolve was probably Amborella , i.e. Amborellaceae is the sister group to all other angiosperms, a group that currently has one species in New Caledonia. Th is clade, along with Nym- phaeaceae and Austrobaileyales, form the basal lineages to the angiosperms. Th is basal clade currently accounts for ~0.1 per cent of extant angiosperms. Th e remaining 06-WillisandMcElwain-Chap06.indd 22306-WillisandMcElwain-Chap06.indd 223 11/28/13 2:21 PM11/28/13 2:21 PM 224 6 FLOWERING PLANT ORIGINS 99 per cent of angiosperms are now thought to have radiated slightly later from fi ve clades known as the ‘core group’, namely Chloranthales, Magnoliidae, Monocots, Ceratophyllales, and Eudicots. 9. Examination of cladistic analyses based on morphological and molecular traits of both extant and fossil material indicates that angiosperms were probably derived from a single common ancestor. 10. Traditionally the suggested precursor to the angiosperms included members of the seed plants Bennettitales and/or Gnetales. However, recent phylogenetic analyses that include extinct as well as extant seed plant clades place Caytoniales as the closest link between the gymnosperms and angiosperms, although there is still some debate around this point. 11. Reconstruction of the biogeographical distribution of vegetation during the Maas- trichtian (~72–66 Ma) indicates that seven global biomes can be recognized during this period, with all but the highest latitudes dominated by angiosperms. 06-WillisandMcElwain-Chap06.indd 22406-WillisandMcElwain-Chap06.indd 224 11/28/13 2:21 PM11/28/13 2:21 PM 7 The past 66 million years A consideration of the past 66 million years (Cenozoic) is vital to understanding the evolution and distribution of the present-day fl ora. During this time continental plates moved into their present arrangement, prominent mountain ranges, such as the Himalayas, Alps, Carpathians, Caucasus, Zagros, and Rockies, were formed, and the global climate, which was initially very warm, became increasingly cool, culminating in a build-up of ice at the poles. Against this backdrop of changing environmental con- ditions, major changes occurred in the overall composition and distribution of global vegetation. Angiosperm groups continued to diversify and modernize throughout the Cenozoic, grass lineages evolved, and a long-term decline in the aerial extent of forests and expansion of grasslands occurred. Th e past 66 million years is therefore regarded as ‘the period of time that we must look to for the precursors of most modern taxa and plant communities’ ( Tallis, 1991 ). 7.1 Environmental changes over the past 66 million years (Cenozoic) Early Palaeocene to middle Eocene (66–50 Ma) Evidence from the geological record indicates that the interval spanning the early Palaeocene to middle Eocene (66–50 Ma) was one of the warmest periods in Earth history. Reconstructed temperatures from both terrestrial and oceanic sources indicate that a general pattern of global warming occurred through the Palaeocene and that maximum global tem- peratures were reached at ~56.3 Ma (the Palaeocene-Eocene Th ermal Maximum (PETM)) and between 53–51 Ma (the Eocene Climatic Optimum). During the PETM, palaeoclimatic proxies indicate that global temperatures rose by ~5 °C in <10,000 years to values between ~31–34 °C ( Zachos et al. , 2001 ). Similarly, during the Eocene Climate Optimum, tropical temperatures were between 5–10 °C warmer than present ( Zachos et al. , 2008 ). Such were the warm conditions at the tropics that poikilothermic animals could grow to great sizes. For example, fossil evidence for a giant boid snake in northern Columbia has been found dating from this time ( Head et al. , 2009 ). With a length of 13 m and mass of 1,135 kg it is the largest 07-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 22507-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 225 11/28/13 2:23 PM11/28/13 2:23 PM 226 7 THE PAST 66 MILLION YEARS known snake and calculations based on known metabolic rates of poikilothermic animals indicate that to be this size would have required a minimum mean temperature of 30–34 °C ( Head et al. , 2009 ). Reasons for high global temperatures during this period include changing continental confi gurations, increased mantle degassing, volcanic-induced greenhouse warming, and methane-induced polar warming ( Sloan and Barron, 1992 ; Zachos et al. , 2008 ; Kent and Muttoni, 2008 ). In the Palaeocene (~66–55 Ma) the global position of continental plates (with the exception of Australia and New Zealand) had moved close to their present-day position ( Figure 7.1 ). However, the confi guration of the continents was still unfamiliar, as Greenland was attached to North America and Europe was intermittently connected to North America via Greenland. Australia was attached to Antarctica, and there was probably an archipelago connection between South America and the Antarctic Peninsula. In addi- tion, the Mediterranean Sea was unformed and, instead, the Turgai Sea separated Europe from Asia, and Africa was separated from Europe by the Tethys Sea ( Figure 7.1 ). North America was connected to Asia via Berringia (Europe). Th ese continental confi gurations had a signifi cant impact on ocean currents and conse- quently on global climate. Th e greatly expanded Pacifi c Ocean, with vast ocean gyres, car- ried heated tropical waters to high latitudes in both hemispheres. Also, the close proximity of South American and Australian land masses to the Antarctic prevented the development of a cold circumpolar ocean current around Antarctica (as is the present-day situation) ( Lawver and Gahagan, 1998 ; Huber and Nof, 2006 ) and warm equatorial ocean currents were defl ected southward to Antarctica ( Condie and Sloan, 1998 ). As a consequence, per- manent ice cover at the poles was absent ( Miller et al. , 2005 ) and the seas were warm; in the Arctic, for example, estimates suggest that the deep ocean during the early Eocene (~50 Ma) was above 10 °C, similar to that seen presently in subtropical regions ( Lear et al. , 2000 ). Th e prevailing low relief of the continents, coupled with high seas, resulted in Antarctica South America Africa India Australia South China North China Indochina Paciﬁc Ocean Tethys Ocean North America Alaska Arctic Ocean Eurasia North Atlantic South Atlantic Arabia Figure 7.1 Continental conﬁ gurations at 70 Ma.

As a re- sult of these factors the temperature gradient between the equator and poles was there- fore considerably lower during the Palaeocene and early Eocene (66–50 Ma) than exists in the present day ( Sluijs et al. , 2006 ). Estimates derived from palaeosols, phytoplankton, and stomatal densities also indicate that atmospheric CO 2 was considerably higher during the Palaeocene and early Eocene with values in excess of 1200 ppmv (compared to 400 ppmv presently). It was therefore a period of global carbon imbalance, where the output of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere exceeded the uptake by carbon burial ( Compton and Mallinson, 1996 ; Yapp, 2004 ; Lowenstein and Demicco, 2006 ). Th is would have contributed to global warmth through the greenhouse eff ect ( Miller et al. , 1987 ; McElwain, 1998 ; Kent and Muttoni, 2008 ). Middle Eocene to end Pliocene (~50–2.5 Ma) Over the subsequent 48 million years dramatic changes occurred in the confi guration of the continents, both in terms of the relative positions of land to sea and also in the chan- ging topography of the continents through mountain building activity. Th ese changes had a dramatic eff ect upon global climates, by decreasing temperatures and increasing aridity ( Ruddiman, 2001 ). In the southern hemisphere, Australia, New Guinea, Africa, and India continued to move northwards toward their present positions and Antarctica became separated from Australia and the South American archipelago. Th is separation resulted in the develop- ment of a seaway between Australia, Antarctica, and South America—known as the Drake Passage—by the Middle Eocene (~41 Ma), which enabled a circum-Antarctic ocean circu- lation system to develop for the fi rst time ( Scher and Martin, 2006 ) ( Figure 7.2 ). Th e devel- opment of this cold circumpolar ocean current around Antarctica would have prevented warm equatorial currents from penetrating into the southern polar regions. It is suggested that thermal isolation of Antarctica, resulting from this change in ocean currents, was one of the key processes responsible for climatic cooling at the South Pole, the initiation of Antarctic ice sheets, and an associated fall of eustatic sea level ( Lawver and Gahagan, 1998 ; Toggweiler and Bjornsson, 2000 ). Th e splitting of Antarctica from Australia and South America was eff ectively the end of Gondwana and initiated a trend toward cooler glacial climates ( Kennett, 1977 , 1995 ). In the northern hemisphere, by the late Oligocene (~30 Ma) sea-fl oor spreading be- tween Greenland and Norway had created marine connections between the Arctic Ocean and the North Atlantic. By the Miocene (~21.5 Ma), Africa had become connected to Asia via the Arabian peninsula, eliminating the Tethys Sea and creating the Mediter- ranean ( Figure 7.3 ). Opening of the Labrador Sea and the Norwegian Sea enabled the establishment of ocean current systems bringing Arctic sea-waters southwards for the fi rst time ( Williams, 1986 ; Wright, 1998 ). Th is would have resulted in the development of cooler and drier climates in the mid to high latitudes of the northern hemisphere ( Briggs, 1995 ). During the Cenozoic a number of major mountain-building episodes are also thought to have had a signifi cant impact on the global climate ( Partridge et al. , 1995 ). Between ~55 and 40 Ma, the uplift of the Himalayas, Tibetan Plateau, and Cordilleras (which 07-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 22707-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 227 11/28/13 2:23 PM11/28/13 2:23 PM 228 7 THE PAST 66 MILLION YEARS include the Rocky Mountains) occurred ( Chase et al. , 1998 ; Harrison et al. , 1998 ) fol- lowed by the Pyrenees, Carpathians, Caucasus, and Zagros mountains between ~35 and 25 Ma ( Condie and Sloan, 1998 ). It is suggested that the changing topography result- ing from these mountain-building episodes would have contributed to a general cli- matic trend of increasing aridity and the formation of desert and arid biomes. Increased aridity was driven by both the physical mass of emerging mountain ranges restricting the movement of moisture-bearing winds into continental interiors, and an increased proportion of water becoming land-locked in polar ice-caps, thus decreasing moisture Figure 7.2 The separation of Australia from Antarctica during the late Eocene (~37 Ma), resulting in the development of a seaway between Australia (A), Antarctica (An), and South America (SA), known as the Drake Passage, which enabled a circum-Antarctic ocean circulation system to develop for the ﬁ rst time.

It is also suggested that these mountain-building episodes would have had a signifi cant draw-down eff ect on atmospheric CO 2 , contributing to a reduction in global temperatures through a reduced greenhouse eff ect ( Berner, 1995 ; DeConto and Pollard, 2003 ; DeConto et al. , 2008 ; Pagani et al. , 2011 ). It is estimated, for example, that increased rates of uplift and erosion associated with the formation of the Himalayan mountains and Tibetan Pla- teau would have provided a large, new source of calcium silicate minerals for chemical weathering. Weathering of the silicate minerals would have transferred carbon from the atmosphere to carbonate minerals (CO 2 + CaSiO 3 ↔ CaCO 3 + SiO 2 ), which ultimately were buried as ocean sediments. Th is process is thought to have resulted in the long-term removal of CO 2 from the atmosphere during the Eocene and Miocene ( Raymo et al. , 1988 ; Raymo and Ruddiman, 1992 ; Ruddiman et al. , 1997 ). Estimates suggest, for example, that atmospheric CO 2 concentration declined from levels approximately four times higher than present in the late Cretaceous (~100 Ma) to levels equivalent to those of the present day by the Miocene ( Figure 7.4 ) ( Berner, 1991 , 1994 ; Pearson and Palmer, 1999 ; Royer et al. , 2004 ; Pagani et al. , 2011 ). Th e overall eff ect of these changing continental confi gurations, ocean circulation pat- terns, and a reduction in atmospheric CO 2 concentrations, was a long-term decline in global temperatures through the Cenozoic ( Figure 7.4 ). Overall declining temperatures and build- up of ice at the poles also increased equator to polar temperature gradients. Glaciological evidence suggests that major ice-sheet formation began at the South Pole from as early as 35–30 Ma ( Hambrey et al. , 1991 ; Hambrey and Barrett, 1993 ). In the North Pole, terrestrial ice-sheet formation was initiated somewhat later, in the late Pliocene (3–2.5 Ma) ( Kennett, 1995 ; Maslin et al. , 1996 ; Hay et al. , 2002 ).

Th is decline marked the major expansion and permanent growth of the East Antarctica ice sheet ( Flower and Kennett, 1994 ), a trend toward a lower global sea level ( Haq et al. , 1987 ; Miller et al. , 2005 ) and the initiation of glacial climates in the Arctic. Another period of warming then occurred during the mid- Pliocene (3.6–2.6 Ma) when cli- matic conditions were, on average, warmer than present day ( Jansen et al. , 2007 ; Haywood et al. , 2009 ) with the palaeoclimatic evidence and modelling to suggest that the greatest Figure 7.4 Trends in Cenozoic deep sea temperature (a) and atmospheric CO 2 based on proxy data (b).

A long-term pattern of global climatic cooling therefore emerges for the Cenozoic, onto which shorter- term fl uctuations of both warming and cooling can be superimposed ( Figure 7.4 ). The Pleistocene (2.5 Ma to 11 kyr) Th e end of the Pliocene (from ~2.5 Ma) was heralded by further decreases in global temper- atures resulting from a combination of environmental factors, including a long-term decline in atmospheric CO 2 (e.g. Maslin et al. , 1996 ; Royer et al. , 2004 ). Th is resulted in the build-up of large ice-sheets in the northern hemisphere, and from this point onward the Earth was locked into recurrent glacial–interglacial cycles. During the Pleistocene there have been at least ten of these cycles, with glacial conditions accounting for almost 80 per cent of the time ( Shackleton et al. , 1995 ). The timing of glacial–interglacial cycles has been closely linked to variations in in- coming solar radiation, resulting from variations in the Earth’s orbit around the sun and the tilt and wobble of the Earth on its axis ( Imbrie and Imbrie, 1979 ) (termed Milankovitch cycles). During the glacial periods, continental ice-caps covered large areas of land in mid to high latitudes in both hemispheres, with low global temperatures and precipitation creating harsh environments. In the low latitudes, aridity and slightly cooler temperatures prevailed. In contrast, during the interglacials conditions similar to or warmer than present occurred ( Williams et al. , 1993 ; Willis and MacDonald, 2011 ). Concentrations of atmospheric CO 2 also became greatly reduced during the glacial periods, with estimates suggesting concentrations on average around 180 ppm, con- trasting with an average value of 300 ppm during interglacial periods ( Petit et al. , 1999 ; EPICA, 2004 ). Viewed over the past 410 million years, however, the environmental changes that have occurred over the past 2.5 Ma appear minor. No major continental plate movements have occurred and levels of atmospheric CO 2 have been at their lowest in Earth’s history. Th e en- vironmental factors of real signifi cance during the Pleistocene are the extended periods of time when Earth has been locked in a glacial phase. Th e impact of these glacial phases upon long-term patterns of plant evolution will be discussed in Chapter 9 . 7.2 Biogeographical distribution of global vegetation between ~60 and 50 Ma (late Palaeocene to early Eocene) Evidence from diverse fossil fruits, seeds, leaves, pollen, and wood all indicate that the veg- etation of the late Palaeocene and early Eocene (~60–50 Ma) was adapted to a warm and moist global climate, with a global predominance of forested ecosystems and a remarkably low equator to polar temperature gradient ( Utescher and Mosbrugger, 2007 ) ( Figure 7.5 ). In fact this was one of the most diverse intervals and had the most extensive coverage of tropical everwet forests in Earth’s history ( Morley, 2011 ; Willis et al. , 2010 ; Willis and MacDonald, 2011 ) with tropical rainforest reaching up to latitudes of 40° north and south ( Figure 7.6 ). Neotropical pollen diagrams from sites in Columbia and Venezuela that cover 07-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 23107-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 231 11/28/13 2:23 PM11/28/13 2:23 PM 232 7 THE PAST 66 MILLION YEARS this interval in time indicate a large increase in diversity across the PETM warming but also a large turnover in community composition ( Jaramillo et al. , 2010 ). Th e vegetation of this interval was therefore markedly more diverse and possessed more tropical elements than that of the warm, but slightly cooler, preceding early Palaeocene ( Wing et al. , 1992 ; Jaramillo et al. , 2006 , 2010 ; Harrington and Jaramillo, 2007 ; Wing et al. , 2005 ). Six biomes have been recognized for this interval, based on the original biogeographical analysis of Wolfe ( 1985 ) , Meyen ( 1987 ) , Tallis ( 1991 ) , Janis ( 1993 ) , and reviews by Collinson ( 1990 ) , Manchester ( 1999 ) , and Utescher and Mosbrugger ( 2007 ), in conjunction with evidence from climat- ically sensitive sediments ( Boucot et al. , 2001 ) ( Figure 7.6 ). Seasonality and day length are thought to have been primarily responsible for the distribution of major vegetation types during this interval ( Wolfe, 1985 ). Tropical everwet biome Tropical rainforests may have originated as far back as the mid-Cretaceous ~100 Ma ( Upchurch and Wolfe, 1987 ; Davis et al. , 2005 ); however, it is not until the early Palaeocene that the fi rst unequivocal evidence for the presence of highly diverse rain- forest vegetation is apparent in the fossil record at the Castle Rock locality in Colorado Figure 7.5 Geographical position of important Eocene fossil localities and an assessment of the dominant plant functional/vegetation types preserved at each.

Th is remarkably preserved fl ora contains many of the traits that characterize modern day tropical rainforests, including high species diversity and spatial heterogeneity, large leaf size (megaphylls), and a high proportion of leaves with entire non-toothy margins and drip-tips ( Figure 7.7 ) ( Johnson and Ellis, 2002 ). In terms of area covered, the tropical everwet biome of the late Palaeocene to middle Eocene provided the most extensive humid tropical climatic conditions since the appearance of angiosperms ( Figure 7.6 ) ( Burnham and Johnson, 2004 ; Jaramillo et al. , 2006 ) or indeed since the expansive tropical swamps of the late Carboniferous. In this vast region, span- ning the majority of present-day South America, Africa, South-East Asia, and south- ern and western North America, a closed multistratal tropical rainforest developed that was dominated by angiosperms ( Morley, 2011 ). Angiosperms underwent continuous ( Couvreur et al. , 2011 ) to rapid ( Davis et al. , 2005 ) diversifi cation and modernization in this biome. Vegetation of the entire tropical everwet biome was dominated by evergreen angiosperms with large, entire-margined leaves greater than 12 cm in length (megaphyl- lous), oft en with drip-tips, indicating humid and warm climatic conditions without cold or dry seasons ( Wolfe, 1985 ; Utescher and Mosbrugger, 2007 ). Many angiosperm fam- ilies found in present-day tropical environments, such as Bombacaceae, Annonaceae, Rhizophoraceae, Guttiferae, Malphigiaceae, and Dipterocarpaceae, were fi rst recorded in this tropical zone fossil pollen and leaves ( Figure 7.8 ) ( Lakhanpal, 1970 ; Morley, 2000 ). Palms were diverse and abundant based on fossil evidence ( Mai, 2000 ) and have diversi- fi ed steadily since the mid-Cretaceous, thus contributing to the overwhelming diversity within tropical everwet forests today ( Couvreur et al. , 2011 ). In contrast, conifers, in- cluding the families Araucariaceae and Podocarpaceae, and ginkgos were present but rare ( Johnson and Ellis, 2002 ; Wilf et al. , 2003 ).

However, the poleward extent is marked by bands of evaporites, indicating seasonally arid (summerwet) or perhaps even desert condi- tions, in northernmost Africa (with the exception of the coasts), central Asia, and southern South America and Africa. Nevertheless, the presence of abundant fl oras of tropical rainforest aspect along the western coast of North America up to 50°N clearly indicates that this biome extended much further poleward along coastal regions than it does today ( Wolfe, 1985 ). Summerwet biome Paratropical forest Th e vegetation spanning much of northern Europe, North America, and Russia in the northern hemisphere, and eastern Australia and parts of Argentina in the southern hemi- sphere between 60 and 50 Ma was truly unique in terms of composition and poleward extent. Th is vegetation, which has been referred to as paratropical rainforest ( Wolfe, 1985 ), contained an unusual mixture of what are now either tropical or temperate elements, and was fringed along the coasts by mangrove swamps ( Collinson, 2000a ; Utescher and Mos- brugger, 2007 ). Angiosperm families present in this biome included members of Anac- ardiaceae, Anonaceae, Burseraceae, Cornaceae, Lauraceae, Sapindaceae, and Sabiaceae, all of which are almost entirely tropical to subtropical in their present distribution ( Col- linson, 2000a ). Cashew nuts found in sediments of an early Middle Eocene lake in Ger- many confi rm the presence of the Anacardium genus in Europe approximately 50 Ma ago ( Manchester et al. , 2007 ). Lianas and climbers belonging to Vitaceae, Menispermaceae, and Icacinaceae were also common elements of the fossil fl oras making up this biome, as were palms, which were diverse. 07-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 23507-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 235 11/28/13 2:23 PM11/28/13 2:23 PM 236 7 THE PAST 66 MILLION YEARS Mangrove swamps fringed the paratropical forests along the coastlines of present-day Eng- land, France, and Belgium in the northern hemisphere, and along the coastline of Tasmania at 65°S in the southern hemisphere. Th ese coastal swamps were dominated by the palm Nypa , and members of the Rhizophoraceae, including Ceriops , were also common ( Pole and Macphail, 1996 ; Collinson, 2000a ) ( Nypa is now restricted to mangrove swamps of South- East Asia). Th e poleward extent of the paratropical forest was approximately 50° in both hemispheres and up to 65° along the coasts. Th e presence of mid- to high-latitude bauxites, in association with coals ( Boucot et al. , 2001 ), helps to defi ne the poleward extent of the summerwet biome at this time. Such a high poleward extent of vegetation characterized by a high proportion of tropical elements clearly represents a peak in ‘tropicality’ for the entire Cenozoic (65–0 Ma) ( Graham, 1999 ). Paratropical forest occurs today in slightly seasonal, humid climates of southern China and adjacent highlands of South-East Asia ( Olson, 1985 ). 0 Pliocene Miocene Oligoc. Eocene Paleoc.

Th ese areas included northern Tibet ( Li et al. , 1984 ), southern Australia ( Greenwood, 2000 ), and parts of Argen- tina ( Romero, 1986 ). In southern Australia, for example, the vegetation was dominated by evergreen angio- sperm trees with leaf sizes that were typically notophyllous to mesophyllous, similar to those of subtropical forests of this region today ( Greenwood, 2000 ). ‘Notophyllous’ and ‘mi- crophyllous’ refer to the leaf lengths, which were typically between 8 and 12 cm and less than 8 cm, respectively. In contrast, leaves of the tropical and paratropical rainforests were typically greater than 12 cm in length, and are referred to as ‘megaphyllous’. Members of Lauraceae were dominant among the angiosperms in the more arid regions of Asia in the northern hemisphere, and these were intermixed with more xeromorphic groups such as Casuarinaceae, and groups with microphyllous leaves such as Cunoniaceae, Myrtaceae, and Elaeocarpaceae, indicating more seasonal subtropical climates ( Li et al. , 1984 ). Evergreen conifers, including Araucariaceae and Cupressaceae ( Libocedrus ), were also common. Summerwet/semi-desert biome Th e absence of coals, together with the presence of evaporites and calcretes in parts of present-day North Africa, central Asia, and parts of South America, mark the most arid regions, which were probably transitional between summerwet and semi-desert conditions during the early Eocene. Palaeoenvironmental reconstructions suggest a Mediterranean-like climate occurred across Central Asia during this period, generating a zonal desert and steppe region ( Zhang et al. , 2012 ). In addition, fossil fl oras from north, west, and central China contain signifi cant percentages (as much as 80 per cent) of dry-adapted (xerophytic) shrubs, such as Nitraria and Ephedra , which are indicative of semi-desert or desert conditions ( Li et al. , 1984 ). However, these shrubs were apparently intermixed with deciduous forest taxa, such as Alnus , Betula , Enhelhardia , Juglans , and Liquidamber ( Li et al. , 1984 ), indicating that full desert conditions had not yet developed in these regions; certainly in East China during the Eocene, evidence suggests that the East Asian monsoon was occasionally active ( Zhang et al. , 2012 ). Today both Ephedra and Nitraria are extremely xerophytic desert dwellers. Th e areas that were probably fully subtropical desert are indicated in Figure 7.5 . Fossil fl oras of Eocene age from parts of southern Europe have been classifi ed as subxerophytic (drought adapted) ( Mai, 1995 ) to Savannah woodland ( Cavagnetto and Anadón, 1996 ). Warm temperate biome Th e dominant vegetation of this biome tended to be evergreen with entire-margined leaves but without drip-tips and has been termed ‘notophyllous broadleaved evergreen forest’ ( Wolfe, 1985 ). Th e warm temperate biome encompassed an area including present-day Canada, Alaska, southern Greenland, and much of north-eastern Asia in the northern hemisphere ( Sunderlin et al. , 2011 ), and Argentina and coastal Antarctica in the southern hemisphere. Fossil evidence suggests that the fl oras of this biome can be classifi ed as an 07-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 23707-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 237 11/28/13 2:23 PM11/28/13 2:23 PM 238 7 THE PAST 66 MILLION YEARS ‘oak–laurel’ tree group, namely Fagaceae, Lauraceae, Th eaceae, and Magnoliaceae ( Olson, 1985 ). A number of fossil plant taxa in this biome also appear to occur in both the subtropi- cal and warm temperate biomes of the northern hemisphere. However, the warm temperate fl oras diff er in that they tend to lack a number of the more thermophylic families, such as Icacinaceae and Menispermaceae, and generally tend to be of lower diversity ( Manchester, 1999 ; Collinson, 2000a ). Members of Icacinaceae are exclusively tropical today, while those of Menispermaceae are mainly, but not exclusively, tropical to subtropical. Th e conditions thought to have prevailed in the warm temperate biome were of a humid climate, with a contrast of mean monthly temperature spanning from 13 to 20 °C ( Wolfe, 1985 ). Th e mean annual temperature of Alaska during this period, reconstructed through leaf characteristics, was signifi cantly warmer than at present, ranging from 11 to 14.6 °C ( Sunderlin et al. , 2011 ). Warm/cool temperate biome Th e cool temperate biome of late Palaeocene and early Eocene times is distinguished by a unique vegetation type that has been referred to as a ‘polar broadleaved deciduous forest’ ( Wolfe, 1985 ). It is remarkable that this polar deciduous forest, which stretched poleward of approximately 70° in both hemispheres, occupied an area of the globe that today is either tree- less polar desert or under ice, including northernmost Greenland, Siberia, Canada, and, in the southern hemisphere, Antarctica. Th ese polar forests have no modern analogue. In the north- ern hemisphere, angiosperm leaf sizes were large but mainly deciduous, including Alnus , Betula , Quercus , Juglans , Populus , and Acer . Many of the conifers present in the northern hemisphere high latitudes were also deciduous ( e.g . Larix , Metasequoia , Pseudolarix , and Tax- odium , as well as Ginkgo ). Th e presence of these mixed deciduous forests in the high latitudes is attributed to much higher polar temperatures and the specifi c light conditions (no daylight in winter but 24 hours of daylight in summer) that would have been of primary signifi cance during growth periods ( Axelrod, 1966 ; Meyen, 1987 ). In addition, the large leaf size probably represents an adaptation to low incidence of solar radiation during the summer and long growing season days, combined with high temperatures (allowing long photosynthetic peri- ods) ( Wolfe, 1985 ). Detailed analysis of high arctic Eocene fl oras from Canada have led to the suggestion that they preserve a forested vegetation analogous to swamp-cypress and broad- leaved fl oodplain forests found today in south-eastern United States ( Eberle and Greenwood, 2012 ). Winter temperatures just above freezing and summer temperatures around 20 °C with high precipitation ( Greenwood et al. , 2010 ) have been inferred from various palaeoclimatic proxies ( Eberle and Greenwood, 2012 ). Mass spore accumulations of the freshwater aquatic fern Azolla in Eocene-aged sediment cores of the Arctic Ocean ( Brinkhuis et al. , 2006 ) in- dicate that the high arctic swamp-cypress forests fringed an ice-free and freshwater-capped Arctic Ocean, providing further evidence for unusually high polar warmth at this time. In the southern hemisphere, the composition of high-latitude forests was somewhat diff erent in that deciduous angiosperms and needle-leaved gymnosperms were rare and the predomi- nant trees were typically evergreen. Trees present included the conifers Araucaria , Podocarpus , and Dacrydium , and evergreen southern beeches ( Nothofagus ). Other angiosperms present, but rarer in their occurrence, included members of the families Loranthaceae, Myrtaceae, Cas- uarinaceae, Ericales, Liliaceae, and Cunoniaceae ( Truswell, 1990 ). Palynological records from 07-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 23807-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 238 11/28/13 2:23 PM11/28/13 2:23 PM 2397.3 THE EVOLUTION OF GRASSES Eocene-aged sediments from Antarctica at 70°S indicate the presence of palms and Bombaca- cea (Baobab), both today associated with tropical distributions, suggesting high polar warmth in corresponding southern polar latitudes ( Pross et al. , 2012 ). 7.3 The evolution of grasses During the latest Cretaceous to early Palaeogene (~70–60 Ma), grasses become apparent in the fossil record. Th is marks one of the most important evolutionary events for human- kind. Estimates suggest that grasses presently provide up to 52 per cent of the carbohydrates (rice, corn cereals) in human diets worldwide ( Raven et al. , 1992 ) along with important material for building and biofuels ( Strömberg, 2011 ). All grasses belong to the angiosperm family Poaceae and presently there are more than 11,000 species of grasses on the planet. Grass-dominated ecosystems include tropical and subtropical savannah, temperate grass- lands, and steppes and cover more than 40 per cent of Earth’s land surface ( Archibold, 1995 ; Gibson, 2009 ). Morphological and molecular analyses of extant grasses indicate that the majority of grass diversity falls into two clades, namely the BEP (Bambususoidae, Ehrhar- toideae, Pooideae), which is made up exclusively of C3 grasses, and PACCMAD (Panicoi- daea, Arundinoideae, Chloridoideae, Centothecoideae, Micrairoideae, Aristidoideae, and Danthonioideae), which contains both C3 and C4 grasses ( Bouchenak-Khelladi et al. , 2010 ). The ﬁ rst grasses Th ere are a vast array of diff erent proxies that have been used to track the evolution and radiation of grasses, including evidence from fossil plant parts (e.g. pollen, macrofossils, plant silica bodies (phytoliths)), soil structure (grassland soils are characterized by gran- ular structures), isotopic content of soils (indicating C3/C4 grasses), and fossil teeth and bone assemblages (e.g. appearance of traits and teeth-wear patterns indicative of mammals that eat grass) (see Strömberg, 2011 for review). All of these indicate that, in evolutionary terms, grasses are very recent with their fi rst appearance during the late Cretaceous/early Palaeogene (70–60 Ma) ( Jacobs et al. , 1999 ; Strömberg, 2011 ) ( Figure 7.9 ). Fossil, morpho- logical, and molecular evidence suggests that the ancestors to the earliest grasses probably originated in the African or South American regions of Gondwana, were members of the BEP clade, and were shade adapted ( Bouchenak-Khelladi et al. , 2010 ). Th e earliest grass pollen and macrofossil records are found in South America ( Barreda and Palazzesi, 2007 ), northern Africa, and India ( Ambwani and Dutta, 2005 ; Prasad et al. , 2005 ). Radiation of the grasses then occurred relatively quickly from the Eocene onwards (55 Ma) such that by ~40 Ma the fi rst open grassland habitats had evolved in South America and by 20 Ma in most global localities ( Janis, 1993 ; Webb et al. , 1995 ; Jacobs et al. , 1999 ; Strömberg, 2011 ). Fossil grass pollen, for instance, indicates that grasses accounted for less than 1 per cent of total pollen abundance between 55 and 40 Ma ( Figure 7.9 ) ( Chandler, 1964 ; Litke, 1968 ). By the early Oligocene (~33 Ma), however, there is evidence from plant macrofossils and pollen, palaeosols (caliche horizons), phytoliths, and grass-like root traces ( Jacobs et al. , 1999 ), and the dentition and skeletal structure of fossil vertebrates ( Janis et al. , 2000 ) to indicate that grasses had started to form a signifi cant component of global vegetation ( Strömberg, 2005 ). 07-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 23907-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 239 11/28/13 2:23 PM11/28/13 2:23 PM 240 7 THE PAST 66 MILLION YEARS From the late Oligocene/early Miocene (28–20 Ma) fossil phytolith studies indicate that grasses no longer occupied an exclusively understory habit within closed forested vegetation but had become the dominant group in truly open habitat grasslands ( Strömberg et al. , 2005 , 2011 ) ( Figure 7.10 ). However, the transition from closed to open habitat grasslands was not a globally synchronous event. Rather it occurred fi rst in South America (Eocene) and last in Australia (late Miocene/Pliocene), with China, North Central America, Western Figure 7.9 Fossil evidence for evolution of the grassland biome in the Cenozoic in the context of global temperature and atmospheric CO 2 change.

Why so late? A number of hypotheses have been proposed for the relatively late evolution of the grasses com- pared with other angiosperm families. Th ese include changing climatic and atmospheric con- ditions, increased frequency of fi res, and changing patterns of herbivory among global faunas. One of the most compelling of these hypotheses suggests that increasing aridity in higher latitudes, especially in the continental interiors, promoted the evolution and expansion of the grasses ( Leopold and Denton, 1987 ; Wing, 1998 ; Osborne, 2008 ; Strömberg, 2011 ). Fossil pollen data and modern phylogenetic analyses suggest that ancestral grasses were Figure 7.10 Record of vegetation changes in North America from closed-habitat (where grasses occupy an understory habit in woodlands) to open-habitat grassland (where grasses dominate and trees are sparse to absent) based on fossil grass phytolith assemblages (represented as pie charts). The timing of the transition from closed to open habitat grasslands inferred from fossil leaves, hoofed mammals and soils are shown as horizontal grey bars. Areas with oblique hatched pattern represent timing of the spread of grass-dominated habitats according to phytoliths; the height of the areas reﬂ ects the degree of uncertainty in timing for each region.

By the Eocene, however, the global distribution of the grass family and fossil occurrences in seasonally arid conditions suggest that a wide range of climatic tolerances, including drought adaptation, had evolved ( Strömberg, 2011 ) ( Figure 7.9 ). Many species of extant grasses are particularly well adapted to aridity, with drought-resistant features such as increased root and decreased shoot growth, a general reduction in physiologi- cal activity in periods of drought, sunken stomata, and thick, dense cuticles ( Archibold, 1995 ). Th ese combined characteristics (traits) are suggested to have conferred a competitive advan- tage to grasses compared with trees in conditions of increasing global aridity. Interestingly there are a number of morphological parallels between plants adapted to aridity and those adapted to nutrient-poor waterlogged conditions. Th is has led to the suggestion that ancestral adaptations to swampy conditions to reduce gas diff usion may have pre-adapted many grasses to arid habitats as they expanded through the Cenozoic ( Bredenkamp et al. , 2002 ). Similarly, many of the traits that enable grasses to withstand periods of drought also provide adapta- tions to the stresses associated with frequent fi res ( Bond, 2008 ). Th us increased fi res, pos- sibly linked with climate change, may have been equally important in promoting the global expansion of grasses. In extant ecosystems, biomass burning is oft en associated with periods of increased aridity ( Dwyer et al. , 2000 ), and in late Miocene pollen sequences from Africa, South Asia, and Australia, for example, grass pollen is oft en accompanied by charred Poaceae cuticle ( Morley and Richards, 1993 ; Morley, 2000 ) ( Figure 7.9 ). It is highly probable, therefore, that the frequency of fi res, especially in the continental interiors, would have increased in concert with increased aridity, thus favouring those plants better adapted to frequent burning regimes. In grasses, the intercalary meristem (the main area from which growth occurs) is in the soil or at ground level. Th erefore, burning of the landscape would not damage the part of the plant responsible for growth. Th is is not the case for other plants. In addition, clearance of vast swathes of forest through burning would have created new niches for colonization and expansion of grasses ( Beerling and Osborne, 2006 ; Bond, 2008 ). Another hypothesis for the comparative late evolution of grasses proposes that a major shift in the balance of global faunas may have played an important role ( Janis, 1993 ). It is sug- gested that an overall decline in numbers of reptiles (and the fi nal decline of dinosaurs) and a major radiation of mammals during the late Cretaceous and early Tertiary ( Janis, 1993 ) may have promoted the co-evolution of Poaceae. Although the fi rst mammals were initially generalized omnivores or herbivores, palaeontological evidence suggests that they gradually became larger and their diets more specialized. By the middle Eocene (~55 Ma), for example, evidence for hoofed mammals (i.e. early horses, camels, and antelopes) with limbs adapted for high-speed running is well established in the fossil record (e.g. Honey et al. , 1998 ; Mac- Fadden, 1998 ). Furthermore, the dentitions of these animals were clearly adapted to a diet high in cellulose and the silica-rich leaves of grasses. As these anatomical features are char- acteristic of species that today inhabit open grasslands and exist predominantly on a diet of grasses, a co-evolutionary link between the expansion of grass-dominated ecosystems and hoofed mammals has thus been hypothesized ( Stebbins, 1981 ). Again, however, the fact that grass leaves have intercalary growth (i.e. the top of the leaf can be eaten or mowed!) and the leaf goes on growing at the base) was probably an important factor in promoting grasses in regions with high levels of grazing ( Janis, 1984 ; Vaughan, 1986 ; Wing, 1998 ; Bond, 2008 ). 07-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 24207-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 242 11/28/13 2:24 PM11/28/13 2:24 PM 2437.4 DECLINE OF THE FORESTS AND SPREAD OF ARIDLAND VEGETATION A number of other angiosperm families that today contain members that are predomi- nantly xerophytic shrubs and herbs adapted to arid ecosystems also made their fi rst appear- ance in the late Palaeocene (~55 Ma) ( Singh, 1988 ; Herendeen and Crane, 1995 ). Th ese include Asteraceae and Agavaceae. Members of the Asteraceae (Compositae) are particu- larly well represented in semiarid regions of the tropics and subtropics today, such as in the tropical and subtropical summerwet biomes, but are also well represented in arctic, arctic– alpine, temperate, and montane fl oras. Members of the Agavaceae, on the other hand, do not have such a cosmopolitan distribution but grow particularly well in arid and semiarid ecosystems of the tropics. 7.4 Decline of the forests and spread of aridland vegetation At least 32 extant families that today possess one or more taxa adapted to climates and habi- tats of extreme or seasonal aridity evolved between the Eocene and Pliocene (~56–5 Ma) ( Table 7.1 ). Most of these ‘arid’ types evolved within highly mixed communities containing both tropical and temperate species. Furthermore, a number of distinctive arid-adapted veg- etation formations, which today occur exclusively in the arid climatic regions of the world, gradually became more recognizable in the fossil record from the late Eocene onwards (~47 Ma) ( Singh, 1988 ; Leopold et al. , 1992 ; Morley, 2000 ). Th ese included tropical and sub- tropical savannahs, temperate grasslands and steppes, deserts (including tropical and polar), tundra, and Mediterranean-type sclerophyllous vegetation. Tropical and subtropical woody savannahs Presently, the term ‘savannah’ is used to describe a broadly defi ned vegetation formation of continuous grass with trees and/or shrubs exhibiting aridland structural and functional Table 7.1 Date of appearance in the fossil record of angiosperm families now having one or more aridland members each (data from Singh, 1988 ).

As such, the term savannah includes pure grasslands, parklands, and low tree and shrub savannahs, to open deciduous woodlands, thicket, and scrubs ( Cole, 1986 ). Tropical savannahs now cover over 23 km 2 between the equatorial rainforests and the mid- latitude deserts and semi-deserts. Th is vegetation formation is characteristic of the modern summerwet biome ( Walter, 1986 ), which incorporates all regions with a strongly seasonal summer rainfall regime and a dry period lasting for four to seven or eight months in the cooler season ( Cole, 1986 ). Th e severity or length of the dry season in the savannah creates a graded series of vegetation types; the shorter the dry season, the greater the proportion of trees present, and the longer the dry season, the greater the proportion of grasses. Th e fi rst unequivocal evidence for the establishment of woody savannah vegetation of more modern aspect comes from middle Eocene (~40 Ma) aged fossil soils in the Great Plains of North America ( Retallack, 1992 ). However, it has also been suggested that subtropical sa- vannahs may have existed within the arid continental interiors from as early as 50 Ma, in the early Eocene ( Janis, 1993 ). Savannah vegetation developed relatively early in South America, Africa, India, Eurasia, and Australia, and many angiosperm trees that are presently used as indicators of savannah vegetation, such as Eucalyptus and Acacia , fi rst became apparent in the late Eocene and Oligocene (~38–23 Ma) ( Lange, 1982 ; Caccavari, 1996 ; Morley, 2000 ). Savannah vegetation containing a high proportion of grasses and herbs does not appear until the Miocene (~16–11 Ma) ( Wolfe, 1985 ; Leopold et al. , 1992 , Strömberg, 2011 ) (Figure 7.10). Temperate grasslands Presently, temperate grassland occupies the continental interiors of the mid-latitudes, where seasonally dry climates favour the dominance of perennial grasses. Th e terminology used to describe these temperate grasslands varies considerably, including, for example, the prairies of North America, the steppes of Eurasia, the pampas of Argentina, and the grassveld of southern Africa. Th e climatic conditions that are associated with modern temperate grass- land vegetation have been broadly classifi ed as regions where there is recurring drought ( Walter, 1986 ; Archibold, 1995 ). As described in Section 7.3 , grass-dominated ecosystems appear diachronously in the fossil record starting in the mid-Eocene in South America but mostly occurring in the early Miocene ( Wolfe, 1987 ; Webb et al. , 1995 ; Wing, 1998 ; Jacobs et al. , 1999 ; Strömberg, 2005 , 2011 ) ( Figure 7.9 ). Fossil evidence from a multitude of both direct and indirect sources suggests that these grassland formations occupied vast areas of the continental interiors of North America, Eurasia, and parts of Africa and south-west America. How similar these grass-dominated ecosystems were in composition to present-day temperate grasslands is still under debate, and some classify them as ‘open-savannah’, suggesting that true temper- ate grasslands did not evolve until the Pleistocene (~2 Ma) ( Janis, 1993 ; Strömberg, 2011 ). Mediterranean-type sclerophyllous vegetation Th ere are presently fi ve regions of the world classifi ed as having Mediterranean-type sclero- phyllous vegetation. Th ese include the Mediterranean basin, California, Chile, the western cape of South Africa, and southern Australia. All of these regions are part of the winterwet biome sensu Walter ( 1986 ) and are characterized by a Mediterranean climate with cool, wet 07-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 24407-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 244 11/28/13 2:24 PM11/28/13 2:24 PM 2457.4 DECLINE OF THE FORESTS AND SPREAD OF ARIDLAND VEGETATION winters and hot, dry summers ( Groves and DiCastri, 1991 ). Th e dominant plant types are shrubs and low trees with small xerophytic, evergreen, and usually leathery leaves ( Larcher, 1995 ). Typical Mediterranean plants of the northern hemisphere include evergreen species of Quercus (e.g. Quercus ilex , Quercus coccifera ), Laurus , Arbutus , Olea , Myrtus , and Cerato- nia . In the southern hemisphere, Banksia and members of Casuarinaceae (desert oaks and she oaks), Restionaceae, and Chenopodiaceae are common ( White, 1990 ). Although winterwet (Mediterranean) climatic conditions are thought to have existed in the Permian ( Ziegler, 1990 ; Rees et al. , 1999 ), Jurassic ( Rees et al. , 2000 ), and late Cretaceous ( Horrell, 1991 ), dry Mediterranean-type sclerophyllous vegetation of truly modern aspect did not become fully established until the Miocene (~10 Ma) ( White, 1986 ; Janis, 1993 ). Th e presence of a number of evergreen sclerophyllous taxa, including Laurus , Arbutus , Cercis , Rhus , Cupressus , Juniperus , and Quercus in middle Eocene fossil fl oras from North America led Axelrod ( 1975 ) to hypothesize that Mediterranean-type vegetation originated from a subhumid vegetation belt that occupied much of North America and Eurasia in the early Tertiary ( Axelrod, 1975 ). Alternatively, it has also been suggested that this vegetation type originated from the older ‘oak–laurel’ tree group, which comprised the notophyllous evergreen forest formation of the warm temperate biome in the late Palaeocene and early Eocene ( Wolfe, 1975 ). Although the exact origin of Mediterranean-type dry sclerophyllous vegetation is still not fully resolved, it is clear that this vegetation evolved as an adaptation to climates characterized by increased aridity and seasonality, sometime from the late Eocene (~37 Ma). Adaptation to frequent wildfi re events was also an important determining factor in relation to the origin and evolution of this biome ( Bond and Keeley, 2005 ). Tundra Present-day tundra is found in polar latitudes and high mountain regions, where the climatic conditions for most of the year are extremely cold and dry with low summer temperatures ( Archibold, 1995 ). Tundra regions are typifi ed by treeless vegetation dominated by shrubs and herbs. In the northern hemisphere, characteristic taxa include sedges ( Carex ), cotton-grass ( Eriophorum ), various species of Ericaceae, and dwarf trees and shrubs, including species of Salix , Betula , Alnus , and Dryas , such as Betula nana and Salix herbacea ( Chernov, 1985 ). In the southern hemisphere, grasses, sedges, and mosses are most common ( Archibold, 1995 ). Janis ( 1993 ) speculated that tundra vegetation could have been present in the southern hemisphere as early as the middle Eocene (~40 Ma). Similarly, in the northern hemisphere a late Miocene (~10 Ma) origin of tundra vegetation has been speculated on the basis of climatic changes associated with the initiation of arctic climates ( Denton and Armstrong, 1969 ; Wolfe, 1985 ). Th ere is as yet little fossil evidence to support either of these suggested origins of tundra vegetation ( Truswell, 1990 ). Th e fi rst unequivocal fossil evidence for tun- dra vegetation of modern aspect in the northern hemisphere is from a Plio-Pleistocene (~2–3 Ma) aged locality at 70°N (Kolyma lowland) ( Wolfe, 1985 and references therein). Deserts Much of the land between 15° and 30° latitude is presently classifi ed as subtropical desert, including, for example, over 40 per cent of Australia, the Sahara desert, and the deserts of 07-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 24507-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 245 11/28/13 2:24 PM11/28/13 2:24 PM 246 7 THE PAST 66 MILLION YEARS South Africa (Namib, Kalahari, and Karoo). Polar deserts are present in high polar latitudes in both the northern and southern hemispheres. Desert climates are characterized by the scarce and variable nature of their precipitation. Although vegetation in deserts is scarce and conditioned by available moisture, they possess a remarkably diverse fl ora. Typical desert plants include small shrubs with narrow, scale-like, and/or water-storing leaves, geophytes, succulents, prostrate cushions and subshrubs, tussock grasses, and ephemeral therophytes ( Archibold, 1995 ; Larcher, 1995 ). Many of the plants now found in desert fl oras were present in the fossil record from as early as the Eocene (~50 Ma) ( Table 7.1 ), although fossil evidence for the fi rst desert vegetation formation of modern aspect is not apparent until 2 Ma ( Wolfe, 1985 ). Th e ap- parent lack of evidence for desert vegetation formations is thought to be due to a variety of factors. First, by their very nature, deserts provide poor preservation potential for plant macrofossils. Secondly, the majority of desert plants are insect pollinated and therefore produce low quantities of pollen. Th irdly, desert vegetation is scarce for much of the year and therefore has less chance of being incorporated into the fossil record. Taking these factors into consideration, it is not surprising that deserts appear to have been anomal- ously absent for most of the Cenozoic. However, detailed pollen and macrofl oral analysis ( Leopold et al. , 1992 ; Guo, 1993 ) and mapping of desert indicator sediments, such as evaporites, point to the presence of deserts and desert vegetation in the Eocene (56 Ma). In the absence of fossilized Eocene cacti or other desert succulents, molecular phylo- genetic studies on extant desert plants provide support for this suggestion. Th ese stud- ies indicate that arid-adapted succulent lineages including Cactaceae (modern diversity ~1850 spp.) and ice plants (Aizoaceae ~2000 spp.) originated in the Eocene and under- went major diversifi cation in the later part of the Cenozoic ( see Section 7.6 ), with evi- dence for the most pronounced diversifi cation events coinciding with further expansion of open habitat grassland biomes in the late Miocene ( Arakaki et al. , 2011 ) ( Figure 7.12 ). In summary, therefore, it appears that desert climates and desert adapted vegetation were present in the Eocene; however, their geographic range was much restricted compared to those of the present day and Mesozoic desert belts. 7.5 Biogeographical distribution of global vegetation between 34–23 Ma (Oligocene) Th e transition from the Eocene to the Oligocene (at ~34 Ma) was a period of signifi cant global climatic cooling and increased aridity, major ocean circulation changes, and the ini- tiation of ice on Antarctica (see Section 7.1 ). Not surprisingly, therefore, major reorganiza- tion and redistribution of global vegetation mirrored these climatic trends, with evidence to suggest that the poleward extent of tropical and paratropical forests became severely re- stricted and the equatorward extent of temperate vegetation expanded ( Figure 7.11 ). Seven distinctive biomes have been recognized in the Oligocene (34–23 Ma), based on the original biogeographical analyses and reviews of Wolfe ( 1985 , 1992 ), Collinson ( 1992 ) , Leopold et al. ( 1992 ) , and Janis ( 1993 ) , and in association with climatically sensitive sedimentary data ( Boucot et al. , 2001 ). 07-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 24607-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 246 11/28/13 2:24 PM11/28/13 2:24 PM 2477.5 BIOGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF GLOBAL VEGETATION BETWEEN 34–23 MA Tropical everwet biome Th ere is little fossil evidence to indicate the exact composition or location of tropical forests during the Oligocene, but it is envisaged that these were similar in composition to those of the late Palaeocene and early Eocene (i.e. dominated by evergreen angiosperms with large, entire- margined leaves, oft en with drip-tips). Th e tropical everwet biome, however, was greatly reduced in latitudinal extent ( Figure 7.11 ). A succession constructed from fossil pollen, taken from the East Java Sea (Indonesia), suggests that there was a signifi cant reduction in rainforest during the early Late Oligocene, and expansion of grassland ( Lelono and Morley, 2011 ), in contrast to the early and end Oligocene. Th e available fossil fl oras from the tropical latitudes provide evidence for numerous tropical angiosperm trees, including Elaeocarpaceae, Burseraceae, Sap- indaceae, Euphorbiaceae, and Fabaceae. Mangrove vegetation also remained abundant along the coast, but was restricted to the tropical and subtropical latitudes, unlike the case in the late Palaeocene and early Eocene, when mangrove swamps extended high into the temperate lati- tudes of both hemispheres, as documented by Kvaček ( 2010 ) in Eocene Europe. It has been sug- gested that during the Oligocene, the range of tropical and paratropical forests may have been even more restricted than at present (pre-20th century) ( Janis, 1993 ). Th is is corroborated in neotropical pollen records; a continuous record of palynomorph diversity from South America shows a steep decline starting in the mid-Eocene (~325 morphospecies) and dropping to less than 250 morphospecies by the early Oligocene ( Jaramillo et al. , 2006 ). Th e authors argue that decreased areal extent of the tropical everwet biome contributed to the dramatic loss in plant diversity to levels lower than those observed in Holocene pollen records from the neotropics. Summerwet biome Th e summerwet biome of the tropics and subtropics encompassed areas of North and South America, Africa, Asia, and Australia between palaeolatitudes of approximately 10–30° in both hemispheres. Th e presence of evaporite deposits indicating climatic aridity ( Boucot et al. , 2001 ) help to defi ne the more arid poleward limits of this biome, whereas the presence of bauxites and coals defi nes the equatorward limit. By the Oligocene, although relatively rare, fossil pollen and macrofl oral evidence suggests that this biome possessed two distinct plant formations, discussed in this section. Paratropical forest Broadleaved evergreen forest vegetation is believed to have occupied the less arid areas of the summerwet biome. Th ese most probably included the areas immediately north and south of the everwet biome in all of the major continents. Common angiosperm families in fossil fl o- ras from Africa included Fabaceae, Anonaceae, Ebenaceae, and Sterculiaceae. It is suggested that the paratropical vegetation formation was similar in composition to the notophyllous broadleaved evergreen forest of the warm temperate biome of the early Eocene ( Figure 7.6 ) ( Wolfe, 1985 ). Th ere are, however, few fossil records to confi rm this suggestion. One of the few examples of this vegetation type comes from a late Oligocene fossil fl ora in southern Yunnan, China ( Guo, 1993 ). Th e vegetation consisted of numerous and abundant evergreen 07-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 24707-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 247 11/28/13 2:24 PM11/28/13 2:24 PM 248 7 THE PAST 66 MILLION YEARS trees of Fagaceae and Lauraceae with entire-margined leaves. Th e majority of fossil leaves were microphyllous, which is indicative of seasonal aridity, typical of monsoon climates of the summerwet biome. Although angiosperm trees and shrubs were dominant, two taxa of gymnosperms were also present: Cephalotaxus and Calocedrus . Reduced temperatures and rainfall through the end Oligocene to Miocene periods are thought to be responsible for the loss of 177 ‘Palaeotropical’ taxa, ranging from paratropical rainforests to temperate laurel forests from south-west Europe, and replacement by ‘Arctotertiary’ fl ora, consisting of more temperate forest types ( Postigo Mijarra et al. , 2009 ). Molecular phylogenetic analysis of the pea family (Legumes) across the African and Australian continents have identifi ed a major extinction event in a lineage through time analysis between 34 and 28 Ma ( Crisp and Cook, 2009 ). Th is extinction event was also most likely driven by Oligocene climatic cooling and is in sharp contrast with the pattern of geographical expansion observed in fossil Legume groups in response to the Palaeocene-Eocene thermal maximum ( Wing et al. , 2005 ). Summerwet/semi-desert biome Th is biome is demarcated by an increased abundance of evaporite deposits and was dom- inated by a vegetation classifi ed as woody savannah. Th ese regions included Mongolia, Kazakhstan, north-western China, and central North America in the northern hemisphere, and parts of South America in the southern hemisphere. Evidence from the fossil pol- len and leaf fl oral record from the Great Plains of America indicates that many drought- adapted shrubs, such as Celtis , Ephedra , Mahonia , and Astronium , became established from the middle Eocene (~40 Ma) ( Leopold et al. , 1992 ). Th e subsequent rapid aridifi cation of North American landscapes during the Eocene/Oligocene transition (~33 Ma) is thought to have prompted the fi rst divergence of Tiquilia (Boraginaceae), an arid-adapted endemic, into the two subgenera present today ( Moore and Jansen, 2006 ). Additional evidence for increasing aridity in this region and a consequent opening up of the vegetation has been elucidated from an examination of fossil soils (palaeosols).

Increasing grass composition in fossil fl oras leading eventually to open habitat grassland dominated ecosystems, discussed above ( Figure 7.10 ), provides further support for the climatic trend towards increasing aridifi cation of conti- nental interiors ( Strömberg, 2011 ). In north-western China, arid-adapted shrubs such as Ephedra and Nitraria (which is presently found in salt deserts such as the Sahara), together with increased abundance of members of the salt bush family (Chenopodiaceae), became established. Fossil pollen re- cords from south central Kazakhstan indicate broadleaved woodland, composed of a mix- ture of subtropical angiosperm trees, shrubby taxa such as Rhus , needle-leaved conifers, herbs, and grasses. Th e vegetation from this region is therefore thought to indicate a trend towards open woody savannah ( Leopold et al. 1992 ; Strömberg, 2011 ). Warm/cool temperate biome A wide band of broadleaved evergreen and deciduous woodland became established through- out central Eurasia and North America and in northernmost Africa in the Oligocene. Th ese woodlands and forests replaced the dominantly evergreen paratropical rainforest (see Section 7.2 ) ( Figure 7.5 ) of the late Palaeocene and much of the Eocene ( Wolfe, 1992 ; Meyer and Manchester, 1997 ; Collinson, 2000b ). Th e warm temperate biome vegetation was composed of cold temperate hardwoods, such as Alnus , Betula , Corylus , Nyssa , Quercus , and Ulmus , warm temperate trees such as Carya , Liquidambar , Cercidiphyllum , Glyptostrobus , and Sequoia , and subtropical taxa such as Engelhardia ( Tallis, 1991 ). Taxodium also became an important elem- ent of swamp forest vegetation in Europe from the Oligocene ( Kunzmann et al. , 2009 ). Changes in fl oristic composition between the Eocene and Oligocene in these regions were characterized by a notable decline in the abundance of plant taxa with tropical or subtropical nearest living relatives ( Collinson, 1992 ), an increase in the abundance of deciduous taxa, and the fi rst major invasion of deciduous so-called ‘arcto-Tertiary’ species ( Kunzmann and Walther, 2012 ), indi- cating migration of taxa from higher to lower palaeolatitudes. Th e percentages of entire-mar- gined leaves also decreased considerably, and the relative percentage of non-entire-margined leaves increased. Th ese fl oristic and leaf physiognomy changes refl ect climatic cooling ( Figure 7.7 Tropical rainforests) during the Oligocene. A famous macrofl ora within this biome is the early Oligocene Hasselbach fl ora from Germany (reviewed in Kunzmann and Walther, 2012 ), which clearly documents the cooling trend compared with Eocene fl oras. Cool/cold temperate biome Th e cool temperate biome incorporated Canada, Greenland, and most of Russia and Siberia in the northern hemisphere and encircled part of the Antarctic continent and the southern tip of South America in the southern hemisphere by the early Oligocene. Th e vegetation of this biome has been referred to as a mixed coniferous and deciduous woodland, similar in general composition to that of the highest latitudes in the early Eocene. Th e climatic cooling at the Eocene–Oligocene boundary appears to have altered the aerial extent of this biome by extending the low latitude limits further equatorward in both hemispheres. Th e dominant 07-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 25007-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 250 11/28/13 2:24 PM11/28/13 2:24 PM 2517.6 THE EVOLUTION OF PLANTS USING THE C4 AND CAM PHOTOSYNTHETIC PATHWAYS vegetation types in the northern hemisphere forests were Metasequoia and Alnus ( Wolfe, 1992 ) and in southern hemisphere forests, Nothofagus and Podocarpus ( Truswell, 1990 ). Polar broadleaved deciduous forest had disappeared from the high latitudes by ~35 Ma; however, some of the important elements of these early Eocene forests (such as Alnus and Metasequoia ) persisted in these high latitudes into the Oligocene. Th e abundance of Pinaceae conifers in high-latitude fossil fl oras of the northern hemispheres increased from the mid- Eocene ( McIver and Basinger, 1999 ). Th is trend may have continued through the Oligocene; however, due to the paucity of high-latitude Oligocene-aged fl oras, this is diffi cult to evaluate. Cold temperate or arctic biome? It has been proposed that from approximately 38 million years ago, tundra communities became established on the land immediately surrounding the ice cap on Antarctica ( Janis, 1993 ) ( Figure 7.11 ). Th is is based on evidence from the fossil pollen record, which suggests that with increasing glaciation, the vegetation of Antarctica became less diverse and more open, with a trend towards vegetation dominated by grasses and Chenopodiaceae ( Truswell, 1990 ; Raine and Askin, 2001 ). Fossil deposits from Prydz Bay in East Antarctica suggest that woody ecosystems were replaced with tundra-like vegetation between the late Eocene to the Oligocene ( Truswell and Macphail, 2009 ), though more studies are required to evaluate the full expanse of these ecological changes. 7.6 The evolution of plants using the C4 and CAM photosynthetic pathways At present, all higher plants can be divided into three categories according to the method by which CO 2 is fi xed in the photosynthetic pathway, namely C3, C4, or crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) ( Table 7.2 ). Th e appearance of plants possessing C4 and CAM photo- synthetic pathways represents one of the most recent evolutionary events to have occurred in the plant fossil record. Th e majority of extant angiosperms, gymnosperms, and pterido- phytes possess C3 photosynthetic pathways, whereas C4 plants are almost exclusively an- giosperms. C4 plants are most common amongst the Poaceae (especially many savannah grasses), summer annuals, and various members of the Cyperaceae, Portulacaceae, Ama- ranthaceae, Chenopodiaceae, and Euphorbiaceae. CAM plants include all of the cacti, most of the Asclepiadaceae, Bromeliaceae, and Orchidaceae, plus some Euphorbiaceae among the angiosperms ( Ehleringer and Monson, 1993 ), and several species of polypodiaceous ferns and Welwitschia mirabilis (Gnetales; Figure 6.23 ) ( Raven and Spicer, 1996 ). Experimental investigations of extant plant groups have demonstrated that the biochemical and physi- ological diff erences between C3, C4, and CAM plants ( Table 7.2 ) directly infl uence their relative responses to diff ering conditions of drought, temperature, and CO 2 concentration ( Ehleringer and Monson, 1993 ). Conditions of high temperature and low precipitation fa- vour plants with C4 and CAM photosynthesis, as they show much more effi cient CO 2 uptake and reduced water loss than C3 plants. C4 plants, however, are less photosynthetically ef- fi cient than C3 plants in cold temperatures (below approximately 5–7 °C) ( Larcher, 1995 ). Th e present-day global distribution of plants refl ects these distinctions, as CAM and C4 07-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 25107-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 251 11/28/13 2:24 PM11/28/13 2:24 PM 252 7 THE PAST 66 MILLION YEARS Table 7.2 Characteristics of C3, C4, and CAM plants Characteristics C3 (e.g. oak tree) C4 (e.g. maize) CAM (e.g. cactus) Evolved (unequivocal evidence) Mid-Ordovician (450 Ma) Mid-Miocene (16 Ma) Quaternary (40,000 years ago) Evolved (equivocal evidence/speculation) Late Carboniferous (300 Ma) and/or Mid- Cretaceous (120 Ma) Late Cretaceous (>130 Ma) Primary CO 2 acceptor for photosynthesis RuBP (ribulose-1,5- bisphosphate PEP (phosphenol pyruvate) In light RuBP, in dark PEP First product of photosynthesis 3-Carbon acids: phosphoglycerate (PGA) 4-Carbon acids: oxaloacetate, malate, aspartate In light PGA, in dark malate Photosynthesis depression by O 2 ?

A combination of anatomical, systematic, and chemical evidence has been utilized to track the fossil record of each photosynthetic group, in order to determine the timing of origin and evolution of the three pathways. Based on these analyses, C3 photosynthesis is considered the ancestral pathway and appears for the fi rst time in the geological record as early as 3500 Ma ( Section 2.4 ). It is widely accepted therefore that the earliest embryophytes (land plants), which evolved in an atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide and relatively low in atmospheric oxygen (conditions that favour C3), possessed the C3 photosynthetic pathway. Th e vegetation of the Earth was exclusively C3 since the origin of land plants until the Oligo- cene (~35 Ma), when multiple lines of evidence point to the origin of a new photosynthetic biochemistry—C4 (reviewed in Sage et al. , 2011 ). Th e C4 pathway represents a series of anatomical and biochemical modifi cations that serve to reduce carbon losses through the process of photorespiration, by internally con- centrating CO 2 above ambient atmospheric levels. C4 plants thus show improved photo- synthetic effi ciency compared with C3 plants at high temperature, low atmospheric CO 2 concentrations, high O 2 concentrations, and in arid environments ( Edwards and Selden, 1992 ; Raven, 1993 ; Sage et al. , 2011 ). Evidence from the carbon isotopic composition of fossil soils (C3 terrestrial plants have lower δ 13 C values than C4 plants; Cerling and Quade, 1993 ; Cerling et al. , 1997 ), fossil tooth enamel (which refl ects the C3/C4 composition of the mammalian diet; MacFadden and Cerling, 1994 ), and from dated molecular phylogenies ( Kellogg, 1999 ; Christin et al. , 2008 ; Kadereit et al. , 2003 ) all support an Oligocene (33 Ma) origin of C4. Th is was followed by multiple independent origins of C4 photosynthesis (over 60) across the plant phylogeny and subsequent rapid global expansion of C4 grass-dom- inated ecosystems in the late Miocene (~7–5 Ma) ( Cerling et al. , 1993 ; Strömberg, 2011 ). Th e Oligocene date of origin of grass with C4 photosynthesis slightly pre-dates the oldest Eudicot lineage with C4 (Chenopodiacceae) ( Kadereit et al. , 2003 ). Th e earliest unequivocal fossil evidence for CAM photosynthesis dates back to approxi- mately 40,000 years ago ( Troughton et al. , 1974 ). It is generally assumed, however, based on both physiological considerations and the antiquity of extant plants possessing CAM, such as Welwitschia , that this photosynthetic pathway evolved sometime in the late Cretaceous (>130 Ma) ( Ehleringer and Monson, 1993 ; Raven and Spicer, 1996 ). Certainly, the origin of many desert succulent plant lineages, which today are exclusively CAM, points to at least an Oligocene and perhaps even an Eocene origin of CAM in angiosperms ( Arakaki et al. , 2011 ) ( Figure 7.12 ). Th e relatively late evolution of the C4 and possibly the CAM photosynthetic pathways com- pared with that of C3 has been the subject of much debate. A possible causal link has oft en been made between the ability of C4 and CAM plants to thrive in hot, dry climates and the climatic evidence for increasing aridity (and temperature in the low latitudes) through the late Oligocene and Miocene ( Cerling et al. , 1997 ). However, as has been shown in Chapters 4 and 5 , there have been many times in Earth history when hot and arid climate regimes prevailed over much greater expanses than were evident in the Miocene. As yet, however, there is no clear evidence supporting evolution of C4 (and possibly CAM) photosynthesis during any of these pre-Miocene intervals, with the possible exception of the late Cretaceous ( Bocherens 07-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 25307-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 253 11/28/13 2:24 PM11/28/13 2:24 PM 254 7 THE PAST 66 MILLION YEARS et al. , 1993 ). Th e lack of any evidence for C4 and CAM plants, particularly in the Mesozoic, when global temperatures and aridity reached a zenith, suggests that other environmental or biological factors must have played an equally important role. One of the main diff erences between earlier periods of high temperature and high aridity, and the Miocene, is that levels of atmospheric CO 2 were signifi cantly lower during the Oligocene and Miocene ( Figure 7.4 ). In competition with C3 plants, C4 plants are favoured under conditions of low atmospheric CO 2 when temperatures are high, due to their ability to concentrate CO 2 within the leaf, thereby re- ducing CO 2 loss by photorespiration ( Table 7.2 ). It has therefore been suggested that a combin- ation of high temperatures in the low latitudes and low levels of atmospheric CO 2 would have increasingly ‘starved’ C3 plants and provided C4 plants with a competitive advantage, leading to their rapid global expansion ( Cerling et al. , 1997 ). Multiple lines of evidence support the hypothesis that low atmospheric CO 2 triggered ( Ehleringer et al. , 1991 ; Kürschner et al. , 2008 ; Christin et al. , 2008 ), or preconditioned for ( Sage, 2004 ; Strömberg, 2011 ; Sage et al. , 2012 ), the origin and expansion of C4 photosynthesis; however, the role of other environmental factors such as high light intensity ( Osborne and Freckleton, 2009 ), salinity, high temperature, and aridity ( Osborne and Sack, 2012 ) were probably also important environmental drivers. 7.7 Biogeographical distribution of global vegetation by 11.6–5.3 Ma (late Miocene) Following a brief period of climatic warming in part of the early and middle Miocene (~18–13 Ma), there was a steady decline in global temperatures ( Zachos et al. , 2001 ; Lear et al. , 2004 ; Mosbrugger et al. , 2005 ; Pound et al. , 2012 ).

Th ese data suggest that a major trend in Cenozoic climate was an increase in seasonality ( Mosbrugger et al. , 2005 ). A drying trend also appeared to continue in the high latitudes ( Janis, 1993 ) (see Section 7.1 ). In contrast, palaeoclimatic reconstruction suggests that temperatures increased once again in the equatorial regions, resulting in steep equator to polar thermal gradients ( Figure 7.13 ). Major ice caps were already established on Antarctica and the initiation of ice raft ing and build-up of terrestrial ice sheets was taking place in the Figure 7.13 A comparison of average land surface (continental) temperatures for the coldest month of the year, based on fossil plant data ( in grey: Utescher et al. , 2011 ) compared with deep ocean temperatures based on the stable oxygen isotopic composition of marine foraminifera shells ( in black: Zachos et al. , 2001 ).

Continental ice caps at the poles caused sea levels to drop and led to a decrease in moisture availability of the global water budget. In consequence, continental interiors became increasingly arid, and large areas of shorelines were exposed due to falling sea level. In the northern hemisphere, for example, sea levels were so low that a land bridge developed between north Africa and southern Europe and the Mediterranean Sea dried out ( Figure 7.14 ) ( Hsü et al. , 1977 ; Hsü, 1983 ). A recently developed palaeo-precipitation proxy based on community levels of hysodonty (tooth crown height) in hoofed mammals ( Fortelius et al. , 2002 ; Eronen et al. , 2010 ) indicates major north- ern hemisphere aridifi cation through the Miocene ( Eronen et al. , 2012 ). Ten major biomes are recognizable by the late Miocene (~10 Ma) (based on biogeographi- cal analyses and reviews of Wolfe ( 1985 ) ; Meyen ( 1987 ) ; Leopold et al. ( 1992 ) ; Collinson ( 2000a ) ) in association with climatically sensitive sediments from Boucot et al. ( 2001 ) . Th e vegetation of this period, which has been described as the ‘age of the herbs’ ( Stanley, 1989 ; Briggs, 1995 ), clearly refl ects the steep equator to polar thermal gradients that were established. Tropical everwet biome By 10 million years ago, a band of tropical rainforest extended across central Africa, northern South America, southern Asia, and the northern edge of Australia ( Figure 7.15 ). Although the overall range covered today by tropical forest is much reduced (due primarily to anthropogenic Figure 7.14 Cartoon from a North Borneo newspaper that reported the ﬁ nding that the Mediterranean Sea was a desert at approximately 5 million years ago. From Hsü, 1983 . 07-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 25607-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 256 11/28/13 2:24 PM11/28/13 2:24 PM 2577.7 BIOGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF GLOBAL VEGETATION BY 11.6–5.3 MA activity), the latitudinal distribution that was in place by approximately 10 Ma has remained much the same to the present day. Th e dominant vegetation was extremely diverse, with abun- dant evergreen angiosperm trees, palms, lianas, vines, and some conifers, including Araucar- iaceae and Podocarpaceae. Nearly all of the tropical families of rainforest vegetation today were in place by the Miocene, including members of the peat swamp forests of South-east Asia ( Morley, 2011 ). Th e Dilleniaceae and Dichapetalaceae, two important families of the Old World tropics, appear in the fossil record for the fi rst time in the Miocene ( Morley, 2000 ). Palynological studies of the Amazonian basin show that by the Miocene, the area was covered by highly diversifi ed and multistratal forest ( Hoorn, 1994 , 2006 ) with a composition not dis- similar to modern tropical Amazonian rainforests. Th e conifer family Araucariacae appears for the fi rst time in the Miocene pollen record of the Amazon ( Dino et al. , 2012 ). Mangrove vegetation characterizes the eastern part of the Amazon basin ( Leite, 2004 ) in the early Mio- cene, whilst a wide variety of typical rainforest taxa are preserved in river deposits including Arecaceae, Melastomataceae, Sapotaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Leguminosae, Annonaceae, and Malpighiaceae ( Jaramillo et al. , 2010 ). Palm swamps dominated by Mauritia are also abundant in Miocene Amazonia and extensive wetlands developed which led to the fragmentation of rainforest ( Jaramillo et al. , 2010 ). Summerwet biome Paratropical forest Tropical forest graded into paratropical forest poleward of approximately 25° in both hemi- spheres. Fossil fl oral evidence for paratropical vegetation is particularly abundant in Yunnan, China, indicating a vegetation dominated by evergreen angiosperm trees with microphyl- lous entire-margined leaves, with some conifers ( Guo, 1993 ). Th e dominant angiosperm families in this forest included Fagaceae and Lauraceae, and species of Pinus , Picea , and Glyptostrobus were the most abundant conifers. Guo ( 1993 ) has interpreted these fl oras as mixed broadleaved evergreen and deciduous forests growing under a monsoon climate gen- erated by the continued uplift of the Himalayas and Tibetan plateau ( Ruddiman et al. , 1988 ; Raymo and Ruddiman, 1992 ; Partridge et al. , 1995 ; Liu and Yin, 2002 ) ( Figure 7.15 ). In Cen- tral Europe, a similar diversity of plant functional communities persisted in what is thought to have been a permanently humid climate ( Utescher et al. , 2007 ). However, in Western Eurasia, the Miocene saw a general transition from predominantly broadleaved evergreen plant communities to those comprised of deciduous elements, especially in response to late Miocene cooling, which has been associated with a drier season ( Utescher et al. , 2007 ). Summerwet/subtropical desert biome Woody and grassy savannah Paratropical forest graded into more impoverished deciduous forest dominated by Fagaceae in the more arid regions of the summerwet biome, such as north-west India ( Meyen, 1987 ), and eventually into open woody savannah in areas of extremely high evaporite occurrence ( Boucot et al. , 2001 ), such as Arabia and central and western Asia. In South America, for example, savannahs with a dominantly grassy ground cover be- came widespread ( Van der Hammen, 1983 ). Indeed, many regions previously covered by 07-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 25707-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 257 11/28/13 2:24 PM11/28/13 2:24 PM 258 7 THE PAST 66 MILLION YEARS broadleaved evergreen forests became areas of open woody savannah, with an increasing proportion of grasses, by the late Miocene (~10 Ma) ( Figure 7.15 ). In parts of Venezuela, the shift from tropical rainforest to savannah may have been in part caused by isolation due to Andean uplift ( Jaramillo et al. , 2010 ). It is also probable that woody savannah oc- cupied a continuous belt from eastern Africa to western India ( Wolfe, 1985 ) and many low latitude regions presently dry, between the equator and 35°, also developed savannah veg- etation from this time, possibly heralding the beginning of desert vegetation formations of more modern aspect. Th e vegetation of these regions consisted of angiosperm shrubs and bushes with xerophyllous leaves and spinose margins. Among the conifers, Pinus and Juniperus increased in abundance and members of the salt bush family (Chenopodiaceae) and other herbs and grasses all show increased abundance in pollen assemblages from the Miocene ( Leopold et al. , 1992 ). Phytolith evidence suggests that grasses also increased in the eastern Mediterranean landscapes of the Miocene, though within open forested habitats rather than in open grass-dominated ecosystems as previously inferred from hyp- sodonty studies in fossil mammals ( Strömberg et al. , 2007 ) ( Figure 7.16 ). In summary, the most signifi cant changes in the vegetation of the summerwet biome appear to be a further opening up of woodland vegetation and increasing abundance of grasses and herbs at the expense of the xerophytic bushes of the Oligocene. Desert vegetation Demarcation of a true subtropical desert biome or vegetation in the late Miocene is dif- fi cult. Similar to the Oligocene and previous stages, there is a paucity of good fossil plant evidence in the most likely arid areas, although an abundance of evaporite sediments at this time is taken to indicate extreme aridity in western Africa, Arabia, and central Asia ( Boucot et al. , 2001 ). Fossil pollen data from Kazakhstan and the Gobi Desert re- gion of China also show high percentages of grasses and herbs, which may indicate Miocene (11.2–5.3 Ma) Figure 7.15 Continues 07-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 25807-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 258 11/28/13 2:24 PM11/28/13 2:24 PM 2597.7 BIOGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF GLOBAL VEGETATION BY 11.6–5.3 MA Figure 7.15 Suggested biomes for the late Miocene (11.2–5.3 Ma) (modiﬁ ed from Wolfe, 1985 ; Janis, 1993 ) with representatives of the most abundant and/or dominant fossil plant taxa shown.

Further investigation is, however, required to establish whether these regions were part of the subtropical desert or summerwet biome, or a transitional type of biome that has no modern analogue as indicated here. With the exception of the Atacama Desert region in South America and the Namib of southern Africa ( Senut et al. , 2009 ), there is limited evidence for arid deserts during the late Miocene (Tortonian age, ~11.6–7.25 Ma), especially in areas where they are found today ( Pound et al. , 2011 ). Global vegetation models, based on climatic reconstructions, support this fi nding, and suggest that tropical seasonal forests had a greater coverage than today during the Tortonian ( François et al. , 2006 ). However, towards the end of this epoch (~5 Ma), there is evidence for mid-latitude deserts, for example the Sahara, Arabian, and Th ar Deserts, as cooling continued and aridity increased coincident with the expansion of polar ice caps ( Senut et al. , 2009 ; Pound et al. , 2012 ). 100% 80% 60% 40% 20% 30% 23% 15% 7%27% 0 % Broad leafed evergreen taxa in palaeovegetation % sclerophyllous (Mediterranean) taxa in palaeovegetation (a) (b) Figure 7.16 Maps showing the relative proportion of broadleaved evergreen taxa (a) in late Miocene fossil ﬂ oras, which indicate warm and humid conditions, versus the proportion of sclerophyllous taxa (b), which indicate dry Mediterranean climate.

By 10 Ma this biome extended along the western coasts of both North and South America, much of southern Europe ( Figure 7.16 ) ( Kovar-Eder et al., ( 2006 ) ) and northern Africa, and south-western Australia, covering a more extensive area than the present-day Mediter- ranean region. Th e vegetation of this biome was typically composed of pine–oak woodlands with microphyllous shrubs and trees, including Arbutus , Rhus , and Ceanothus . Th e only region that is presently classifi ed as having a Mediterranean-type sclerophyllous vegetation that was not part of this formation 10 million years ago is the South African Cape. It is oft en suggested that Mediterranean environments are a relatively recent phenomenon, strongly shaped by anthropogenic infl uence ( Naveh and Vernet, 1991 ; Grove and Rackham, 2001 ). Evidence from the palaeobotanical record and climatically sensitive sediments suggests, however, that winterwet climates were probably in place by the late Cretaceous ( Horrell, 1991 ), and potentially the Permian ( Rees et al. , 1999 ). An important factor in shaping the formation of Mediterranean-type sclerophyll of a more modern aspect in north Africa and southern Europe is thought to have been the desic- cation of the Mediterranean Sea. It is estimated that this would have created cooler and drier local climates and therefore the formation of sclerophyll rather than paratropical forest in north Africa ( Hsü et al. , 1977 ; Wright and Cita, 1979 ; Janis, 1993 ). Warm temperate biome During the Miocene, the warm temperate biome consisted of lowland Taxodium swamps and deciduous forests with Acer , Populus , Salix , and Quercus , to name a few. Broadleaved evergreen components of the vegetation were not as abundant and the whole biome was very much restricted in extent compared with that of the late Palaeo- cene and early Eocene. For instance, fossil floras from regions of Japan, which today possess notophyllous broadleaved evergreen vegetation, indicate the presence of broad- leaved deciduous forests ( Tanai, 1961 , 1972 ) in the early Miocene. The evidence from these fossil leaves therefore suggests that the maximum extent of the warm temperate biome in Asia was south of Japan in the Miocene ( Wolfe, 1985 ). The warm temperate biome incorporated parts of western North and South America, the southern cape of Africa, south-western Australia, and parts of western China. In North America there are no fossil floras from the south-eastern states that conform to this biome-type; how- ever, Graham ( 1999 ) suggests that it is most likely that the vegetation of this region underwent rapid modernization during middle and late Miocene cooling. As a result of cooling, exotic Asian and Neotropical elements were ultimately lost from south-eastern USA, and today warm temperate vegetation is restricted to parts of Florida. By the late Miocene of Europe, much of the warm temperate biome vegetation consisted of a mix of broadleaved evergreen and deciduous forest with Pinus , Cathaya , and Ericaceae on higher slopes. Important taxa of lowland regions included Castenopsis , Quercus , Laura- ceae, and Cunninghamia , similar in composition to humid subtropical forests of mod- ern day China ( Kovar-Eder et al. , 2006 ). 07-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 26107-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 261 11/28/13 2:24 PM11/28/13 2:24 PM 262 7 THE PAST 66 MILLION YEARS Cool temperate biome Th e geographic range of broadleaved deciduous woodland had changed signifi cantly by the late Miocene, extending into areas of Western Europe previously occupied by broadleaved evergreen and mixed mesophytic forests ( Utescher et al. , 2007 ). Th e equatorward limits of this biome were extended from approximately 45° in the Oligocene to 35° in the lowlands and 20° in the highlands by the late Miocene. Th e poleward extent of this biome, on the other hand, became restricted from above 80° in both hemispheres to below 70°, particularly in the continental interiors and in the southern hemisphere, probably refl ecting cooler global temperatures and increased seasonality. Furthermore, by the start of the late Miocene (~15 Ma) the Antarctica landmass had become deforested and tundra vegetation developed in its place, albeit for only approximately 2 million years until glaciers extended and former vegeta- tion became largely depleted ( Pound et al. , 2012 ). Th e composition of vegetation in the cool temperate biome consisted of a mosaic of diff erent plant communities, mainly dominated by diverse angiosperm trees such as Alnus , Acer , Ulmus , Quercus , Betula , Platanus , and Tilia , to name a few, with mixed conifers, including both deciduous and evergreen Pinaceae taxa. Taxodium swamps, which were present in the Oligocene, also persisted in both cool and warm temperate biomes. Shrub/grass steppe; cold temperate biome? As the arid continental interiors of Eurasia and North America became progressively cooler and more seasonal, the vegetation characteristic of these regions in the Oligocene (34–24 Ma) became increasingly open. By the late Miocene (10 Ma) the composition of vegetation of these regions became closer to present-day grasslands, prairies, and steppes ( Fig- ure 7.15 ). Steppes that developed in north-west China were probably related to the orographic eff ect of the rising Himalayas ( Wolfe, 1985 ). New groups such as the aster family (Asteraceae) begin to appear consistently in the Miocene sediments of China ( Leopold et al. , 1992 ), indi- cating an increasing importance of herbs. Similarly, the continued uplift of the Rocky Moun- tains through the Miocene prevented moisture-laden winds from reaching the continental interior of North America. Th e resultant vegetation in the late Miocene appears to have been a mosaic of open deciduous forest woodland and widespread grasslands, with prairie-like as- semblages including Juniper and Celtis ( Graham, 1999 ). More dry adapted near-desert type plant communities containing Ephedra and Artemisia are also evident, for example in western Wyoming ( Barnosky, 1984 ). However, grasslands of modern aspect did not appear in North America until ~1.6 Ma and later in the Quaternary ( Wolfe, 1985 ; Graham, 1999 ). Cold temperate biome Th e appearance of taiga-like vegetation in the late Miocene heralded another vegetation formation of modern aspect, but also indicated further climatic cooling, particularly at the poles, since the Oligocene ( Taggart and Cross, 2009 ). Th is cold temperate biome vegetation spanned the northern hemisphere continents from palaeolatitudes of approximately 50° in the continental interiors to the pole. Presently, taiga is located in the high latitudes of the northern hemisphere (the northern part of the boreal forest) but does not extend all the 07-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 26207-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 262 11/28/13 2:24 PM11/28/13 2:24 PM 263SUMMARY way to the pole, suggesting that although Miocene polar climates had cooled signifi cantly since the Oligocene, they remained warmer than those of the present day. Modern taiga veg- etation is dominated by coniferous trees forming an open-crown lichen woodland ( Sirois, 1992 ) and exists in areas that have low (<0 °C) annual temperatures but summer tempera- tures and humidity that provide suffi cient warmth and moisture for tree growth. Fossil evi- dence from the Canadian arctic (75–80°N) indicates that by 10 million years ago vegetation dominated by narrow-leaved coniferous trees, including Pinus , Picea , and Tsuga , and some broadleaved deciduous angiosperm trees, such as Juglans , had developed ( Hills et al. , 1974 ). Th is combination of predominantly coniferous forest also containing a few deciduous spe- cies, such as Juglans , Betula , Alnus , and Acer , is found in many regions of the present-day global boreal forest and classifi ed as taiga ( Nikolov and Helmisaari, 1992 ). Fossil evidence also suggests that taiga developed in the coastal area of central Siberia from approximately the same time, although it is estimated that it was not until approximately 2 million years ago that taiga attained its present geographical extent ( Wolfe, 1985 ). It has been suggested that this Taiga-like biome may be the youngest biome on Earth and likely originated in very high altitude environments of the Eocene. Global cooling through the Oligocene and Miocene appears to have driven migration of evergreen conifer forests to lower altitudes, eventually spreading to their current circumpolar distribution ( Taggart and Cross, 2009 ). Arctic biome It is speculated that all regions of the Antarctic continent that remained free of ice in the late Miocene were covered by tundra vegetation ( Singh, 1988 ). As was the case for the Oligocene (38–24 Ma), there is limited fossil evidence for tundra until 3 Ma. However, the fossil pol- len record does suggest a trend towards depauperization of high-latitude Antarctic fl oras and deforestation from approximately 10 Ma ( Truswell, 1990 ) or many millennia earlier ( Truswell and Macphail, 2009 ). Th us, by the late Miocene (~10 Ma) not only had all major groups of plants evolved, but also most of the major vegetation types that are presently recognizable (e.g. savannah, tropi- cal rainforest, tundra, taiga, etc.) had also become established. Plant vegetation continued to modernize through the following 10 million years, but the broad scale biogeographical distribution of vegetation from this point in geological time was more a case of ‘rearrange- ment’ of composition and distribution of existing vegetation formations, rather than the establishment of entirely new groups. Th is rearrangement of the biomes has been particu- larly pronounced over the past 2.6 Ma in response to the climatic/environmental changes associated with the Pleistocene glacial–interglacial cycles. Th ese will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 9. Summary 1. Th e climates of the Cenozoic (66–2.5 Ma) can be broadly divided into two periods. Th e fi rst, spanning the early Palaeocene to middle Eocene (66–50 Ma), was one of the warmest periods in Earth history. Estimates suggest that annual tropical temperatures 07-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 26307-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 263 11/28/13 2:24 PM11/28/13 2:24 PM 264 7 THE PAST 66 MILLION YEARS were between 5–10 °C warmer, deep ocean temperatures were between 9 and 12 °C higher than present, and the poles were ice-free. In contrast, during the second period, from the middle Eocene to the end of the Pliocene (50–2.5 Ma), global climates became increasingly cool and arid, and the temperature diff erential between the poles and equator became much more pronounced. 2. Major ice-sheet formation began at the South Pole from as early as 35–30 Ma and at the North Pole during the late Pliocene (3–2.5 Ma). 3. Against this backdrop of long term global cooling during the Cenozoic, two relatively short warm intervals occurred in the earliest middle Miocene (~19.5–15 Ma) and in the mid-Pliocene (3.6–2.5 Ma). 4. Analysis of the biogeographical global distribution of vegetation between 60 and 50 Ma indicates that woodlands of angiosperm trees and shrubs and conifers ranged from pole to pole. Five biomes are clearly recognized at this time, namely tropical everwet, summerwet, summerwet/semi-desert, warm temperate, and warm/cool temperate. 5. Grasses fi rst appear in the fossil record between 70–60 Ma. Radiation of the grasses then occurred relatively quickly during the Eocene (55 Ma) such that by ~40 Ma the fi rst open grassland habitats had evolved in South America and by 20 Ma in most global localities. 6. Th ere are a number of hypotheses accounting for the appearance of grasses in the fossil record at this time, including that their evolution was closely linked with increasing aridity in the higher latitudes, a rise in wildfi re occurrence, and the emergence of hoofed mammals. 7. At least 32 families that today possess one or more taxa adapted to climates of extreme and seasonal aridity evolved between the Eocene and Pliocene (~55–5 Ma). 8. Increased cooling and aridity from the Oligocene onwards (34 Ma) led to the restriction of the tropical and paratropical forests, and the equatorward extent of temperate vegetation expanded. Biogeographical analysis of the vegetation for this period indicates that fi ve to seven distinctive biomes can be recognized in the Oligocene (34–23 Ma), namely tropical everwet, summerwet, warm/cool temperate, cool/cold temperate, and cold temperate or arctic. 9. Plants with the C4 photosynthetic pathway evolved in the Oligocene (34 Ma) along with many desert plant lineages that have a CAM photosynthetic pathway. A combination of high aridity and low CO 2 are thought to have been the main contributing factors accounting for the evolution of these novel biochemical pathways. 10. By the late Miocene (~10 Ma) steep pole to equator gradients had formed. Ice sheets covered the South Pole and were starting to build up in the high latitudes of the northern hemisphere. 11. Ten major biomes are recognized by the late Miocene (~10 Ma), clearly refl ecting the steeper equator to pole gradients. Th ese biomes are still recognizable today. 07-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 26407-WillisandMcElwain-Chap07.indd 264 11/28/13 2:24 PM11/28/13 2:24 PM 8 Mass extinctions and persistent populations Mass extinctions in the faunal fossil record are a well-versed and much debated subject. Unfortunately, the same is not true of the plant fossil record, and there has been less con- sideration given to the question of whether plants have undergone mass extinctions and, if so, whether these were coincident with faunal extinction events and/or share the same trig- gering mechanisms. Similarly, the persistence of certain groups of plants in the fossil record is rarely considered, yet there are just as many plants with extremely long lineages as there are animals, with plenty of examples showing remarkable evolutionary stasis with little, if any, apparent morphological change over the past 2000 million years (e.g. green algae). Th is chapter describes briefl y the ‘big fi ve’ mass extinction events viewed in the marine faunal record. Th e nature and magnitude of these events are then compared to changes apparent in the plant fossil record at the same time. Th e evidence for mass extinction in the plant fossil record is then discussed, with particular reference to the physiological characteristics that might enable plants to be more resilient than animals to the types of environmental change associated with mass extinction events. Finally, examples of the long-term persistence of various families in the plant fossil record are described, and the implications of this in terms of understanding the driving mechanisms behind plant evolution are reviewed. 8.1 Deﬁ nition of mass extinction Mass extinction is a term that has been traditionally used in geology and palaeontology to describe relatively short intervals of geological time when a high proportion of diverse and geographically widespread taxa underwent extinction. Mass extinction diff ers from normal ‘background’ species-level extinction in that it is characterized by the relatively rapid extinc- tion of groups of organisms, usually at a higher taxonomic level, such as families and even orders. Th us, each mass extinction is a real catastrophe brought about by extraordinary en- vironmental factors. It involves substantial biodiversity losses that are global in extent, taxo- nomically broad, and rapid relative to the average duration of the taxa involved ( Jablonski, 1986a , b , 1995 ; Sepkoski, 1986 ). Recent defi nitions suggest that mass extinctions are times when the Earth loses more than three-quarters of its species in a geologically short interval ( Barnosky 2011 ). Th is has happened only fi ve times in the past 540 million years. 08-WillisandMcElwain-Chap08.indd 26508-WillisandMcElwain-Chap08.indd 265 11/28/13 2:25 PM11/28/13 2:25 PM 266 8 MASS EXTINCTIONS AND PERSISTENT POPULATIONS Th ere are a myriad of viewpoints as to how and why mass extinctions occur. Th e under- lying causes can, however, be divided into those that are Earth bound (physical and biologi- cal) and those that are extraterrestrial ( Chaloner and Hallam, 1994 ; Hallam, 1994 ; Huggett, 1997 ). Earth-bound causes include the environmental impacts associated with global cooling and glaciation ( Stanley, 1988 ), massive volcanism ( Loper et al ., 1988 ; Rampino and Stothers, 1988 ; Courtillot, 1990 ; McElwain et al ., 1999 ; Beerling et al ., 2007 ), a reduction of salinity and/or oxygen in the oceans ( Stevens, 1977 ; Kennett and Stott, 1995 ; Wignall and Twitch- ett, 1996 ; Wignall et al ., 2010 ; Brennecka et al ., 2011 ), and changing sea levels ( Hallam and Cohen, 1989 ; Hallam and Wignall, 1999 ; Sandberg et al ., 2002 ). In comparison, extraterrestrial causes include single large impacts from meteorites, comet storms, radiation from supernovae, and large solar fl ares ( Alvarez et al ., 1980 ; Pope et al ., 1998 ; Schulte et al ., 2010 ). Suggested environmental changes associated with these extraterrestrial impacts include shock-waves, heat-waves, ozone destruction and increases in incoming UV radiation, impact winters (long periods of darkness shutting down photosynthesis), super-acid rain, toxic oceans, superwaves, and superfl oods ( Schindewolf, 1963 ; Terry and Tucker, 1968 ; Reid et al ., 1978 ; Huggett, 1997 ). 8.2 Evidence in the geological record: plants versus animals Five mass extinction events have been recognized in the marine faunal record over the past 600 million years. Th ese are oft en referred to as ‘the big fi ve’ ( Figure 8.1 ). Th e fi rst occurred approximately 443 million years ago at the end of the Ordovician, when 12 per cent of marine families ( Raup and Sepkoski, 1982 ), encompassing up to 85 per cent of marine spe- cies, became extinct ( Sheehan, 2001 ; Brenchley et al ., 1995 ; Delabroye and Vecoli, 2010 ). Th e second mass extinction event occurred approximately 372 million years ago at the Frasnian– Famennian boundary in the Devonian. Th is event is marked by a 14 per cent reduction in Figure 8.1 Five big mass extinctions in the fossil marine record.

Th e next mass extinction event, at the Permian–Triassic boundary (252 Ma), resulted in the extinction of up to 90 per cent of all durable skeletonized marine invertebrates and 54 per cent of all marine families ( Erwin et al ., 2002 ; Kamo et al ., 2003 ; Song et al ., 2011 , 2012 ). Th e fourth mass extinction occurred at approximately 201 million years ago at the Triassic–Jurassic boundary. Th is boundary is characterized by the virtual disappearance of ammonoids, a loss of over 20 per cent (approxi- mately 300 families) of marine invertebrates and vertebrates, and major extinctions among insects in the terrestrial realm ( Benton, 1990 , 1995 ; Schootbrugge et al ., 2009 ; Mander et al ., 2010 ). Finally, the fi ft h, and perhaps most famous, mass extinction event occurred at the Cretaceous–Palaeogene boundary (~66 Ma). An 80 per cent reduction in marine inverte- brates ( Surlyk, 1990 ), total extinction of dinosaurs (with the exception of birds), and dras- tic reduction in the number of mammal species ( Halstead, 1990 ) has been recorded at the Cretaceous–Palaeogene boundary ( Schulte et al ., 2010 ). Although the pattern and timing of mass extinction events in Earth history are most sharply defi ned by family-level diversity losses in the marine fossil record, similar trends are also observed, to a certain extent, among terrestrial faunas for at least three of the ‘big fi ve’ mass extinctions. Th ese include the Permian–Triassic (reviewed by Erwin, 1993 ; Erwin et al ., 2002 ), Triassic–Jurassic ( Benton, 1995 ), and Cretaceous–Palaeogene ( Archibald and Bryant, 1990 ) boundaries ( Figure 8.2 ). Th e trends in plant extinctions, and overall diversity changes, on the other hand, are more ambiguous. Th ere were originally thought to be no major peaks of extinction in the plant fossil record comparable to those of the faunal mass extinction events ( Niklas et al ., 1983 ; Knoll, 1984 ; Niklas, 1997 ), with the exception, perhaps, of the Permian–Triassic boundary ( Figure 8.3 ). More recent evidence suggests that some boundaries saw similarly large changes in turnover and diversity losses in the plant fossil record, although extinctions were oft en not so dramatic (local-regional) and the impact on Figure 8.2 Mass extinction events in the fossil terrestrial record. Diversity curve for terrestrial tetrapod families (after Benton, 1989 ). Six mass extinction events are recognized (letters a–f). Republished from Huggett, R. J.

Aft er examining briefl y the main trends in the faunal fossil record, plant responses across all four mass extinction events of the Phanerozoic (that is, those that occurred over the past 400 million years) will be discussed in detail in the following sections. Frasnian–Famennian boundary (late Devonian) (372.2 Ma) Over half of the marine genera present on Earth, accounting for more than a fi ft h of all families, did not survive the Frasnian–Famennian mass extinction ( McGhee, 1996 ). Th is event, which is oft en referred to as the late Devonian mass extinction, lasted for an estimated 3 million years, and resulted in the decimation of most major marine taxa, including cnidar- ians, stromatoporoids, brachiopods, foraminiferids, phyllocarids, echinoderms, benthic algae, cephalopods, conodonts, fi shes, phytoplankton, and zooplankton ( Bond et al ., 2004 ). A number of causes have been suggested, including an asteroid or multiple asteroid impacts ( McLaren, 1983 ; John et al ., 2010 ), oceanic anoxia ( Buggisch, 1991 ; Knoll et al ., 2007 ; Bond and Wignall, 2008 ), global climatic cooling ( Copper, 1986 ; Streel et al ., 2000 ), and even global climatic warming ( Brand, 1989 ). Th ere is much debate as to whether similar levels of extinction occurred among terrestrial plants at the Frasnian–Famennian boundary. Th e late Devonian was a time of marked specia- tion and radiation of many diff erent plant groups, including lycopsids, sphenopsids, fi licopsids, and progymnosperms, and is characterized by the establishment of the fi rst extensive forests ( see Chapter 4 ). A number of studies have demonstrated that this trend of increased diversity and radiation through the Devonian period was punctuated by a number of marked plant extinction events ( Banks, 1980 ; Richardson and McGregor, 1986 ; Boulter et al ., 1988 ). Th e suggestion has therefore been made that these extinction events were coeval with those occur- ring at the Frasnian–Famennian boundary amongst diverse marine faunal groups. Evidence for extinction in late Devonian fossil plant assemblages, for example, indicates that a reduction in overall species number occurred at the Givetian–Frasnian boundary (~382 Ma) ( Figure 8.4 ) ( Banks, 1980 ). Similarly, a decrease in overall plant species number at the Frasnian– Famennian boundary (~372.2 Ma) was observed in a sequence from New York State ( Richardson and McGregor, 1986 ). Using the evidence from these studies, the suggestion was therefore made that a mass extinction of a comparable nature to that seen in the marine faunal record occurred among terrestrial plants during the late Devonian. However, this interpretation has been criti- cized on a number of counts ( Traverse, 1988a ; McGhee, 1996 ). First, it was suggested that it was impossible to draw this conclusion from two studies, both with very small sample sizes. Secondly, it was suggested that a biased selection of taxa was chosen in the analyses and that this gave a false impression of the scale of the decline ( Figure 8.3 ). Th irdly, it was argued that since these two episodes of extinction apparent in the plant fossil record were asynchronous (approx- imately 3 million years apart), they did not suggest a single large event. Fourth, and perhaps the most signifi cant, was the observation that neither macrofossil nor microfossil records from these two sequences demonstrated extinction among high taxonomic levels, such as families or orders; thus, in the strict sense of the defi nition, neither represents ‘mass extinction’. A study that was carried out to address a number of the limitations associated with previous studies also found confl icting evidence. Detailed analyses of 338 assemblages of 08-WillisandMcElwain-Chap08.indd 26908-WillisandMcElwain-Chap08.indd 269 11/28/13 2:25 PM11/28/13 2:25 PM 270 8 MASS EXTINCTIONS AND PERSISTENT POPULATIONS compression/impression fossils compiled from the literature, including assemblages from North America, Europe, the Russian platform, Spitzbergen, and Bear Island ( Raymond and Metz, 1995 ), demonstrated a reduction in generic diversity of between 30 and 40 per cent across this transition – thus a change in turnover but nothing comparable to the reduction observed in the faunal record. Th is led to the suggestion that low diversity at this boundary may refl ect sampling bias or result from low origination rates during this interval rather than high extinction rates. Similarly, a study of survivorship rates across this boundary using global plant family records in order to remove some of the bias contained in taxonomic de- scriptions at species level ( Cascales-Miñana and Cleal, 2012 ) concluded that the Frasnian– Famennian extinction had little noticeable eff ect on land vegetation. End-Permian (252 Ma) Th e end-Permian marks an interval in Earth history when between 90 and 96 per cent of all durable skeletonized marine invertebrate species ( Raup, 1979 ) and 54 per cent of all marine families ( Sepkoski, 1986 ) became extinct ( Figure 8.5 ). As such, this mass extinc- tion event was the greatest in the history of life, and has been referred to as ‘the mother of mass extinctions’ ( Erwin, 1993 ), ‘Palaeozoic nemesis’ ( Hallam and Wignall, 1997 ), and other equally dramatic terms. As in the case of the Frasnian–Famennian extinctions, Figure 8.4 Three palaeoecological studies thought to demonstrate mass extinction: (a) total species curve based on 171 fossil spore taxa ( Richardson and McGregor, 1986 ); (b) total species curve based on 64 megafossil taxa ( Banks, 1980 ) (both redrawn from Boulter et al ., 1988 ); and (c) standing diversity at interval boundaries based on 338 fossil assemblages ( Raymond and Metz, 1995 ).

More specifi cally, suggested environmental triggers include an intense period of volcanism ( Renne et al ., 1995 ), a major drop in sea level due to a decline in sea-fl oor spreading ( Holser and Magaritz, 1987 ; Erwin, 1993 ), a bolide impact ( Alvarez et al ., 1980 ), global cooling ( Stanley, 1988 ), global warming ( Retallack, 1999 ), oceanic anoxia ( Wignall and Hallam, 1992 ; Wignall and Twitchett, 1996 ), and greatly elevated CO 2 ( Knoll 2007 ; Heydari et al ., 2008 ) ( Figure 8.6 ). Of these many potential mechanisms (reviewed in detail in Erwin, 1993 ; Hallam and Wignall, 1997 ), it is most likely that the greatest biotic crisis in Earth history was driven by a multitude of interacting factors rather than just one individual mechan- ism ( Hoff man, 1989a , b ; Erwin, 1993 ; Martin, 1998 ). Suggested kill mechanisms associated with these environmental triggers (reviewed in Knoll et al ., 2007 ) can be broadly divided into those directly associated with change in atmospheric composition and those related to the ensuing climate change. Th e former include death due to i) asphyxia associated with oxygen depletion; ii) a decrease in capacity of respiratory pigments in animals to oxygen- ate tissues and reduction in the precipitation of carbonate skeletons in marine organisms resulting from elevated CO 2 ; and iii) hydrogen sulphide poisoning related to volatile fl ux from volcanic activity of the Siberian traps. Suggested kill mechanisms associated with climatic changes include radiation death resulting from increased UV-radiation, and death due to the physiological stresses of hotter and/or colder temperatures ( Knoll et al ., 2007 ; DiMichele et al ., 2009 ).

Although there has been much discussion in the literature that a ‘mass’ extinction event oc- curred among plants, the general picture suggests widespread ecological turnover with dra- matic reduction in plant taxa in some regions ( Hilton and Cleal, 2007 ; DiMichele et al ., 2008 ; Hochuli et al ., 2010 ) but probably not globally ( Erwin, 1993 ; Cascales-Miñana and Cleal, 2012 ) ( Figure 8.7 ). Prior to the Permian–Triassic boundary, world vegetation was domi- nated by lycopsids, sphenopsids, fi licopsids, cordaites, and pteridosperms ( see Chapter 5 ). During the late Permian and early Triassic (259–247 Ma) a gradual transition occurred with the reduction, and eventual extinction, of Palaeozoic groups and the emergence and major radiation of cycads, ginkgos, bennettites, and conifers ( see Chapter 6 ) ( Figure 8.8 ). It seems apparent from the available evidence, therefore, that the predominant longer-term trends over the Permian–Triassic boundary involved major reorganization of plant communities and evolution of new species ( Di Michele et al ., 2008 ). Th e question is, therefore, whether there is evidence for a more rapid and catastrophic reduction in fossil plant diversity at the Permian–Triassic boundary that can be superimposed on, and could account for, this longer-term trend. A number of studies have addressed this question, with mixed results. In the mid to high latitude localities in the northern hemisphere, a number of studies look- ing at evidence from fossil pollen and plant macrofossils indicate that this transition was a time Figure 8.6 Multiple causes leading to the end-Permian mass extinction event. The possible direct causes of the end-Permian mass extinction are to the right, with the more indirect causes progressively to the left.

In sedimentary records from the Barents Sea, the Norwegian Sea, and Greenland Sea that span the Permian–Triassic transition ( Hochuli et al ., 2010 ; Looy et al ., 2001 ; Mangerud, 1994 ), for example, there is evidence for a large reduction in woody gymno- sperms across the landscape, which were replaced by herbaceous lycopsids and ferns ( Hochuli et al ., 2010 ). Some have described this transition as one of widespread and excessive dieback of terrestrial vegetation ( Visscher and Brugman, 1981 ; Visscher et al ., 1996 ). In addition, many of the spores bear evidence of genetic damage in the form of fused tetrads, with a suggested link to UV-induced mutagenesis as a result of ozone layer depletion ( Visscher et al ., 2004 ; Foster and Afonin, 2005 ; Beerling et al ., 2007 ). Following this event, there is a recovery of gymnosperms with the whole interval of rapid fl oral turnover occurring in less than ~200 kyr at some local- ities ( Hochuli et al ., 2010 ) and up to 4–5 Ma at others ( Looy et al ., 1999 ) indicating a short-lived high disturbance event and no evidence for the extinction of large number of families that is comparable to that seen in the marine record. Th is is a pattern that is replicated throughout the northern hemisphere including sites in northern and southern China ( Peng and Shi, 2009 ; Yin Figure 8.7 Survivorship of plant families from the Silurian to the present using polycohort analysis. Each line represents a survivorship curve for all the families that are present during a particular time interval (= polycohort). Termination of the survivorship curve indicates extinction of all the families that were present in the polycohort. The survivorship curve declines through time indicating the extinction of some families within the polycohort. Deﬂ ection in the survivorship curve indicates increased extinction rate of families. The most marked extinction events observed in this analysis are indicated with arrows at the Permian–Triassic boundary, followed by the Triassic–Jurassic, Devonian–Carboniferous, and Cretaceous–Tertiary (Palaeogene). © 2011 Borja Cascales-Miñana, Christopher J.

In terms of overall diversity there was therefore a reduction in high-diversity vegetation dominated by gymnosperms to a low- diversity, fern-dominated fl ora at the Permian–Triassic boundary ( Dobruskina, 1987 ; Kürschner and Herngreen, 2010 ) but this diversity then recovered ( Hochuli et al ., 2010 ; Lindström and McLoughlin, 2007 ). In the southern hemisphere, however, a somewhat diff erent pattern emerges. Here, in some sites (e.g. Queensland, Australia), are parallels with northern hemisphere sites to indicate fl oral turnover events with a reduction in gymnosperms and a peak in lycopods followed by recovery ( Morante, 1996 ). In contrast at other sites there is evidence for a sig- nifi cant extinction event. Macrofossil evidence from the Sydney basin ( Retallack, 1995 ), for example, indicates the disappearance of up to 97 per cent of fossil leaf species and loss of up to 19 per cent of families. Th ere was also the extinction of the dominant glossopterid and cordaite vegetation and their replacement by shrubby pteridosperms, volzialean conifers, and lycopsids ( McLoughlin et al ., 1997 ; McElwain and Punyasena, 2007 ). Evidence from the plant fossil record for a mass extinction event at the end-Permian that is comparable to that seen in the animal record is therefore ambiguous. Th ere was clearly signifi cant ecological upheaval and turnover apparent in all regions (for a review see McElwain and Punyasena, 2007 ), mass migrational shift s ( Rees et al ., 2000 ), and a marked decline in the level of plant family survivorship across the Permian–Triassic boundary but evidence for the rapid global extinction of large numbers of plant families is not apparent. In this sense the fl oral fossil record is at odds with the faunal record at the end Permian. Plant lineages appear to be more resilient in the face of major environmental upheaval than are animals ( Knoll, 1984 ; Niklas, 1997 ; Wing, 2004 ; McElwain and Punyasena, 2007 ). Triassic–Jurassic boundary (201.3 Ma) Th e Triassic–Jurassic boundary marks the third greatest faunal extinction event in Earth his- tory, where 23 per cent of marine families ( Benton, 1995 ), 63 per cent of marine invertebrate genera ( Alroy et al ., 2008 ), and 22 per cent of terrestrial animal families ( Benton, 1990 ) went extinct. Th is boundary is also notable for the almost complete extinction of ammonites, with the exception of one genus, and a dramatic disappearance of reef ecosystems. Th ere are a number of candidate environmental conditions that are thought to have triggered this mass extinction event and most of these are linked to the massive interval of volcanism as- sociated with the opening of the Atlantic Ocean and eruption of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Providence (CAMP) ( Hesselbo et al ., 2002 ; McElwain et al ., 2007 ; Whiteside et al ., 2010 ). It is estimated for example that this volcanic episode would have resulted in the release of more than 8000 Gt of atmospheric CO 2 ( Beerling and Berner, 2002 ) leading to super-elevated atmos- pheric CO 2 ( Steinthorsdottir et al ., 2011 ) and a rise in global temperatures of between 3 and 6 °C ( McElwain et al ., 1999 ; Huynh and Poulsen, 2005 ). A large increase in pollutants such as sulphur dioxide and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is also predicted to have occurred (linked to vol- canic activity emissions), resulting in massive depletion of stratospheric ozone ( Schootbrugge et al ., 2009 ). Massive release of methane from frozen methane hydrate reserves in ocean sedi- ments has also been invoked as a potential indirect eff ect of CAMP volcanism ( Ruhl et al ., 2011 ). Th is combination of environmental triggers would have led to a similar set of ‘kill’ mechanisms ( sensu Knoll et al ., 2007 ) as described above for the end-Permian mass extinction event. 08-WillisandMcElwain-Chap08.indd 27508-WillisandMcElwain-Chap08.indd 275 11/28/13 2:25 PM11/28/13 2:25 PM 276 8 MASS EXTINCTIONS AND PERSISTENT POPULATIONS Figure 8.9 High resolution study of environmental and vegetation change across the Permian–Triassic boundary. Change in environmental conditions are inferred from shifts in the stable carbon isotopic composition (δ 13 C) of organic carbon. A shift in δ 13 C to more negative values typically indicates a dramatic change in atmospheric composition and potentially climate. Shifts in the relative abundance of pollen and spores indicate palaeoecological change in the vegetation. The timing of extinctions among marine invertebrates is indicated with stars (*).

In sites throughout the northern hemisphere there is evidence for widespread change in species composition ( McElwain and Punyasena, 2007 ; McElwain et al ., 1999 ; Bonis and Kürsch- ner, 2012 ; Mander et al ., 2010 ). For example, three well-dated sequences from Germany and Sweden indicate a dramatic decline in arborescent gymnosperms (including Pina- les and cycads- ginkgophytes) to a fl ora dominated by ground ferns, tree-ferns, horse- tails, and mosses ( Schootbrugge et al ., 2009 ). Changes in vegetation composition were complex and varied spatially across the globe; continental interiors in many parts of the northern hemisphere became dominated by Cheirolepidaceae, a drought adapted coni- fer, whereas coastal regions developed seasonally fl ooded wetlands with low abundances of woody taxa and fern domination ( McElwain et al ., 1999 ; Bonis and Kürschner, 2012 ) ( Figure 8.10 ). Regions that straddle climatic or biome boundaries, such as along the east Figure 8.10 Geographical coverage of vegetation change across the Triassic–Jurassic boundary based on fossil pollen and spore data. A major observed trend is the transition from a mixed vegetation to one dominated by Cheirolepidiaceae conifers (indicated by widespread abundance of Classopollis pollen) immediately post T–J boundary. Fern dominated assemblages become dominant in other regions. These somewhat contradictory patterns of vegetation change could indicate a shift in the pattern and timing of precipitation towards increased seasonality in some regions and increased precipitation in others.

In terms of overall richness change across this boundary, macrofossil evidence from sites in Greenland indicate loss of up to 85 per cent species richness ( Mander et al ., 2010 ; McElwain et al ., 2007 ) and the tempo of biodiversity loss was sudden rather than gradual ( McElwain et al ., 2009 ). Th is is a pattern seen throughout sequences in northern Europe and North America, with estimates indicating up to 95 per cent turnover of spe- cies at this boundary in some sites ( Harris, 1937 ; Visscher and Brugman, 1981 ; Fowell et al ., 1994 ). Morphological changes also occurred in plant groups across this boundary; large-leaved fossil plant taxa, which were present before the Triassic– Jurassic boundary, were replaced by related taxa with smaller or more dissected leaves (which were able to cool more effi ciently and avoid high-temperature injury) aft er the boundary ( McElwain et al ., 1999 ). Changes in the dominant leaf structure of the vegetation impacted fi re re- gimes across the Triassic–Jurassic boundary by increasing leaf fl ammability, as experi- mental data show that narrow leaves burn faster, hotter, and release more volatiles than do broadleaved forms ( Belcher et al ., 2010 ). Th e density of stomata on leaf surfaces de- creased by half across the Triassic–Jurassic boundary, resulting in a 50 per cent reduction in canopy level transpiration ( Steinthorsdottir et al ., 2012 ), which in turn probably had signifi cant consequences for the hydrological cycle, leading to great run off and erosion ( Figure 8.11 ). Similar to the end-Permian, there is evidence for massive ecological upheaval, migrations, range shift s, and adaptation by plants at this boundary. Th is upheaval resulted in local to regional extinctions, with up to 85 per cent of species becoming locally to regionally extinct across North America, Greenland, and Europe (for a review see McElwain and Punyasena, 2007 ). Despite abundant evidence for major ecological upheaval across the Triassic–Jurassic boundary, only a single plant family went globally extinct, the Peltaspermaceae seed ferns Figure 8.11 Summary of environmental and vegetation change across the Triassic–Jurassic boundary, at Astartekløft, East Greenland.

Even this is questionable if the peltasperms are, as suggested, within the corystosperm clade ( Hilton and Bateman, 2006 ), which is a group of seed ferns that survives into the Triassic. Overall, therefore, the vast majority of plant families appeared to have survived the environmental challenges posed at this bound- ary ( Schootbrugge et al ., 2009 ; Cascales-Miñana and Cleal, 2012 ), again demonstrating the resilience of plant lineages compared with animals. Cretaceous–Palaeogene boundary (66 Ma) Th e extinction event at the Cretaceous–Palaeogene (K–Pg) boundary (formerly known as the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary, K–T) is the most widely known and studied of the ‘big fi ve’ mass extinctions, due to public and scientifi c interest in the extinction of dinosaurs. Th e boundary is also marked by up to 80 per cent extinction of marine invertebrate species and a drastic reduction in the number of mammalian species. Among the marsupials, for example, only opossums persisted beyond this boundary. Some estimates suggest that between 60 and 80 per cent of all living animal species became extinct ( Raup, 1988 ). Suggestions to account for this mass extinction include an intense period of volcanism ( Self et al ., 2006 ; Chenet et al ., 2009 ), global sea-level changes ( Offi cer and Drake, 1985 ; Courtillot, 1990 ), and/or a catastrophic asteroid impact ( Alvarez et al ., 1980 ; Smit, 1980 ; Schulte et al ., 2010 ), among many others. Evidence in favour of a bolide impact hitting Earth approximately 66 Ma comes from both marine and terrestrial sources (for a review see Schulte et al ., 2010 ). Th ere is abundant evidence for a large asteroid ~10 km in diameter hitting the Earth on the Yu- catan Peninsula in Mexico at this time. Th is resulted in the formation of the ~180–200 km diameter Chicxulub crater, with global consequences. Suggested environmental con- sequences of such a large asteroid impact include earthquakes and tsunamis ( Toon et al ., 1997 ) and a large impact plume that released large quantities of water, dust, and climate- forcing gases into the atmosphere. It is estimated, for example, that between ~100–500 Gt of sulphur was injected into the atmosphere within minutes of the Chicxulub im- pact ( Schulte et al ., 2010 ). Th is sulphur was probably rapidly transformed to sunlight- absorbing aerosols, leading to dramatic global cooling by up to 10 °C lasting for decades ( Pierazzo et al ., 2003 ). Climatic conditions associated with such an impact would there- fore include a prolonged period of darkness, intense cold, and acid rain. Such a suite of environmental changes would have had deleterious eff ects on many types of terrestrial and marine fauna. Evidence in favour of an interval of intense volcanism driving the extinctions at the K–Pg boundary is found in geological records that indicate a 1 million year-long interval of volcanism associated with the Deccan fl ood basalts in India ( Courtillot and Renne, 2003 ; Self et al ., 2006 ). It is estimated that this interval of volcanic activity would have released vast quantities of SO 2 and CO 2 into the atmosphere and had profound impacts on the climate (cooling, warming, and acid rain). Th e SO 2 would also have greatly depleted the ozone layer resulting in enhanced UV-B fl ux. Th ere is still much discussion within the literature as to the most likely cause of the mass extinctions apparent in the animal fossil records at this time. Regardless of the cause, the 08-WillisandMcElwain-Chap08.indd 27908-WillisandMcElwain-Chap08.indd 279 11/28/13 2:25 PM11/28/13 2:25 PM 280 8 MASS EXTINCTIONS AND PERSISTENT POPULATIONS impact was global and occurred over a relatively short interval in time (1–2 Ma). However, similar to the other mass extinction events, evidence for a global mass extinction of plants of a magnitude similar to that seen in the faunal record is ambiguous. Global vegetation at the Cretaceous–Palaeogene boundary was dominated by angiosperms in almost all of the major biomes ( Chapter 6 ), with the fi rst unequivocal evidence for grasses also appearing in the fossil record around this time (between 70–65 Ma) ( Jacobs et al ., 1999 ; Strömberg, 2011 ; Chapter 7 ). It was one of the most prolifi c intervals of angiosperm species diversity increase, with total numbers of plant species increasing rapidly ( Figure 8.12 ). It is therefore against this backdrop of increasing plant species number that evidence for a mass extinction event must be sought. Various sedimentary sequences have indicated fl oral changes associated with the Cretaceous–Palaeogene boundary (for a review see Nichols and Johnson, 2008 ) ( Fig- ure  8.13 ). Analyses of fossil pollen sequences from the western interior of North Amer- ica, for example, indicate a sudden decrease in the abundance and diversity of fossil pollen grains ( Smit and Van der Kaars, 1984 ). Th is was followed by a sharp and rapid rise in fern spore abundance. Fossil pollen abundance increased again aft er the ‘fern-spike’ but indicates a very diff erent composition of fossil plants from that which existed prior to the boundary ( Figure 8.13 ). Similarly, evidence from other sites in North America indicates an equally Figure 8.12 Diversity curves for vascular plant species over the past 440 years ( see also Figure 6.2 ).

In addition, a series of palynological sequences in Japan ( Saito et al ., 1986 ) and New Zealand ( Vajda and McLoughlin, 2004 ) indicate a sud- den change in fl oristic composition at the K–Pg boundary ( Figure 8.14 ). In both cases, the pollen profi les show a transition from a high abundance of angiosperm and gymnosperm pollen, to a high proportion of fern spores, followed by an increase in gymnosperm ( Pinus ) pollen in Japan. An increase in fungal hyphae and spore abundance is recorded in New Zealand, coinciding with high levels of iridium ( Figure 8.14 ), suggesting an increase in deg- radation and decomposition processes in response to the environmental changes triggered by a meteorite impact. In the macrofossil record, studies of species occurrence and leaf characteristics across the K–Pg boundary also reveal some signifi cant changes. A severe decline in macrofossil species diversity is recorded across the Cretaceous–Palaeogene boundary in Western North Dakota ( Johnson, 2002 ) ( Figure 8.15 ). Importantly, the biodiversity loss plant species does not coincide with any evidence for an equivalent decline in the number of fossil specimens collected from sediments, suggesting a real extinction event rather than a bias in the fossil record ( Wing, 2004 ; Figure 8.15 ).

Biotic events include extinction of species (A), mass appearance of opportunistic species (B), and radiation of new species (C). Major environmental disturbance is indicated by a strong shift to negative stable carbon isotopic composition (D), a sharp decrease in calciﬁ cation in the oceans (E), and a spike in the concentration of the rare earth element Iridium, indicating a meteorite impact.

Phase 1 (pre-K–Pg boundary) indicates a vegetation consisting of a fl ora of both broadleaved and small-leaved evergreen angiosperms, with thick, hairy cuticles. Comparison with extant vegetation types indicates that this type of vegetation is found in dry, subhumid regions. Th e next phase (phase 2) (at the K–Pg boundary) indicates a fern spike, where the fl ora is dominated by leaves and rhizomes of ferns and other herbaceous vegetation types. Phase 3 (post-K–Pg boundary) indicates a fl ora composed of large leaves with drip-tips and thick, smooth cuticles (usually indicative of early successional vegetation in an environment of high precipitation), followed by phases 4 (post-K–Pg boundary) and 5 (post-K–Pg boundary), which indicate a more diverse assemblage typical of low-diversity rainforest. It is suggested that these patterns, seen in both the microfossil and macrofossil records across the K –Pg boundary, are typical of fl oristic change associated with ecological trauma ( Wolfe and Upchurch, 1986 ). In particular, the rise in abundance of fossil ferns at the K– Pg boundary is thought to indicate rapid re-vegetation aft er widespread environmental Figure 8.14 Changes recorded in the concentration of iridium (parts per billion; ppb) and the relative abundance of fungi, ferns, conifers, and ﬂ owering plants across the Cretaceous–Palaeogene boundary at Moody Creek Mine in New Zealand.

Similarly, the marked changes in macrofl oras (mostly fossil leaves) are thought to refl ect responses to the climatic changes associated with such an impact and, in particular, the eff ects of an ‘impact winter’ ( Upchurch and Wolfe, 1987 ; Wolfe and Upchurch, 1987 ; Wolfe, 1991 ). Unlike the animal record, however, the scale and extent of trauma suff ered by vege- tation was geographically variable and extinctions were largely confi ned to the rank of species rather than genus, families, or orders. Where there was extinction apparent, the pattern of those plants that went extinct appears to have been highly selective in both space and clade. Extinction risk, for example, appears to have been higher among insect- pollinated than wind-pollinated members of the Cretaceous plant clades ( McElwain and Punyasena, 2007 ; Nichols and Johnson, 2008 ). In addition, evergreen families (e.g. Laurales, Illicales, and Cyclanthales) seem to have been more prone to extinction with macrofossil evidence to indicate that at sites in North America, these species went extinct Figure 8.15 Record of plant extinctions across the Cretaceous–Palaeogene boundary in western North Dakota as indicated by changes in the number of fossil leaf species recorded in sediments. The severe decline in species numbers across the K–Pg is not accompanied by an equivalent decline in the number of fossil specimens collected, indicating real extinction and diversity loss in these ecosystems.

However, even within the American continent, fossil evidence illustrates great variation in vegetation turnover between regions. Comparison of fi ve Cretaceous–Palaeogene assem- blages located in a south to north transect ( Figure 8.17 ) reveal, for example, that levels of extinction were high in the southern States but low in the northern States ( Spicer, 1989 ). Th us, even in the regions that record dramatic fl oral changes (e.g. North America), it re- mains debatable whether the event can be strictly classifi ed as a mass extinction ( Halstead, 1990 ). Although a reduction in overall biomass occurred, there is little evidence to suggest a major global extinction similar in magnitude to that seen in the animal record ( Niklas, 1986 ; Lidgard and Crane, 1988 , 1990 ) ( Figures 8.12, 6.26 ). In fact, few to no fl owering plant families were permanently lost from across the globe and species diversity did eventu- ally recover in all regions—even though this took up to 1 Ma ( McElwain and Punyasena, Figure 8.16 Changing leaf assemblages across the K–Pg boundary. Leaves in phase 1 are indicative of broadleaved evergreen vegetation with high diversity, probably representing subhumid conditions. Phase 2 consists of leaves, rhizomes, and cuticles, typical of ferns and herbs—taken to be indicative of wildﬁ res. Phase 3 is indicative of a ﬂ ora composed of plants with large leaves and with drip-tips and thick, smooth cuticles, typical of early successional vegetation in an environment of high precipitation. Phase 4 and 5 indicate vegetation adapted to warm and humid conditions with gradually increasing diversity but still considerably lower than that recorded in phase 1.

Lineage through time (LTT) analysis based on molecular phylogenies indicates that for some clades, such as Menispermaceae (mostly tropical vines) ( Wang et al ., 2012 ) and tropical epiphytic ferns ( Schuettpelz and Pryer, 2009 ), the Cretaceous–Palaeogene bound- ary interval was a time of their most rapid diversifi cation. It appears, therefore, that some clades benefi ted from the extinction of others, although LTT analysis is a new technique and it can be diffi cult to distinguish rapid radiation events from mass extinction events ( Crisp and Cook, 2009 ). In summary, therefore, it would appear that at each of the major faunal mass extinction events there is evidence for dramatic ecological turnover in the plant fossil record. However, there is no evidence for mass extinctions of a similar magnitude to those seen in the animal record ( Table 8.1 ). Interestingly, this pattern of ecological plant turnover appears to have been pretty Figure 8.17 Assemblages across a south to north transect in North America, indicating the vegetation impact at the K–Pg boundary.

At each boundary, plants that had woody traits were temporarily lost and plants with traits including a herbaceous stature and/or spore production (e.g. ferns, club-mosses) became dom- inant. Following the event, woody species once again recovered, but oft en this took a relatively long time (between 1–3 Ma) and usually there was a change in the dominants. Interestingly, the plants to become post-boundary dominant were usually present before the boundary but at low abundances, suggesting the removal of the dominants at the boundary signifi cantly altered competitive interactions ( McElwain and Punyasena, 2007 ). In terms of diversity, at each Figure 8.18 Record of plant ecological change across the P–T, T–J, and K–Pg (a–q) compared with changes in carbon isotope values (δ 13 C org , vertical lines); only x-axis values are to scale.

Despite there being no mass extinctions as such, the impact of these altered ecosystems could have been profound and had global implications. For example, there is evidence for changes in drainage basin patterns in Antarctica ( Retallack and Krull, 1999 ), South Africa ( Ward et al ., 2000 ), Australia ( Michaelsen, 2002 ), and Greenland ( Steinthorsdottir et al ., 2012 ) and increased erosion from land into the sea due in part to reduced vegetation cover ( Sephton et al ., 2005 ) and also due to a physiologically induced reduction in canopy transpiration ( Steinthorsdottir et al ., 2011 ). Both mechanisms would increase overland fl ow and run-off , resulting in soil erosion. Th e impact that these intervals of ecological turnover had on both terrestrial and marine ecosystems should not therefore be under-estimated—even if the plant lineages themselves demonstrate remarkable resilience and persistence in response to dramatic global disturbance. 8.3 Why no mass extinction in the plant fossil record? Why are there diff erences in the levels of extinction between the animal and plant kingdoms? Furthermore, how do these diff erences comply with evolutionary models that propose mass extinction as the uppermost tier in evolutionary hierarchies, i.e. that ‘mass extinction has the strongest impact on life’s subsequent history’ ( Gould, 1995 )? It has been suggested that the lack of mass extinction in the plant fossil record as op- posed to the faunal record is due in part to the greater ability of plants to withstand major ecological trauma. As humorously noted by Knoll ( 1984 ) , if you go into a zoo and hammer all the animals on the head, you eff ectively have the end of the zoo. However, if you go into a botanical garden and burn or scythe all the plants down, in 10 years’ time you will still have a botanic garden, with the majority of plants sprouting once again. Vascular plants have a very limited set of basic needs, namely water, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), nitrogen (N), magnesium (Mg), phosphorous (P), potassium (K), plus some trace elements ( Knoll and Niklas, 1987 ; Niklas, 1997 ). Th is list is not only small in comparison to that required by animals, but also basically universal among all plant groups, and has barely changed throughout geological time. Th us it is assumed that this list was the same for the swamp-dwelling Lepidodendron trees of the Carboniferous as it is for modern orchids and daisies. In terms of resources, therefore, plants have relatively basic elemental requirements. Plants also have various in-built mechanisms for coping with environmental stress ( Knoll, 1984 ; Traverse, 1988a ). Th ese include leaves or whole-branch systems that wilt or can be shed during periods of drought, the ability to die back to the ground and perennate as under- ground stems or rhizomes, to lie dormant during periods of adverse weather, to survive for long periods of time in seed banks, and to reproduce without sex by vegetative reproduction. Th ese will be discussed in detail in Section 8.5 . Most plants also have the potential to migrate away from unfavourable biological or environmental conditions through transportation of pollen and seeds via wind, animal, and water vectors. In addition, it has been demonstrated that plants are not nearly as sensitive to population size dynamics as animals. Th us a ‘deme’ of vascular plants, consisting of only a few individuals, can persist far better than a small deme of tetrapods, for example. Moreover, if a population size is greatly reduced, plants within a small population are more likely to persist than animals ( Traverse, 1988a ). Plants 08-WillisandMcElwain-Chap08.indd 28708-WillisandMcElwain-Chap08.indd 287 11/28/13 2:25 PM11/28/13 2:25 PM 288 8 MASS EXTINCTIONS AND PERSISTENT POPULATIONS can also undergo mosaic evolution, whereby diff erent organs on the same plant can develop independently of each other. Th is is an extremely useful tool, especially during times of en- vironmental stress, as it enables a plant to protect its total genetic make-up by altering one organ (leaves for example) while retaining all others unchanged. Leaf shape and stomatal density changes evident in fossils spanning the Triassic–Jurassic boundary are examples of this in the fossil record ( McElwain et al ., 1999 ; Belcher et al ., 2010 ; Steinthorsdottir et al ., 2012 ). A combination of these features has therefore enabled plants not only to cope with periods of intense ecological trauma, such as those associated with faunal mass extinction events, but also to persist for millions of years in the geological record. 8.4 Evidence for persistence in the plant fossil record Th e fact that a majority of plant families survived some of the greatest environmen- tal upheavals recorded in Earth history at the Permian–Triassic, Triassic–Jurassic, and Cretaceous–Tertiary boundaries attests to the persistence of plants as a group. Another good example of persistence is evident across the Palaeocene Eocene Th ermal Maximum (PETM), a global warming event approximately 55 Ma. Proxy temperature records indicate that global temperatures were raised by between 5 to 10 °C within 10,000 to 20,000 years at the PETM, which resulted in a marked extinction of bottom-dwelling marine organisms. By contrast, no family-level extinctions are recorded from North American fossil fl oras ( Wing et al ., 2004 ). Instead, the responses of the vegetation to climatic warming included poleward migration towards higher latitudes, adaptation of leaf physiognomy, and a change in ecological composition ( Wing et al ., 2004 ; Willis and MacDonald, 2011 ). At the PETM, therefore, it appears that the rate of magnitude of climate change did not exceed the cap- acity of global vegetation to adapt to the new climate regime or maintain existing climate envelopes through migration ( Willis et al ., 2010 ; Willis and MacDonald, 2011 ). Evidence from extant taxa indicates that, in general terms, organisms with an exceptionally long evo- lutionary history are much more abundant among terrestrial plants than animals ( Traverse, 1988a ). Very few animals appear to be as closely related (morphologically) to their fossil relatives as plants, and from morphological evidence alone it would appear that a number of plant taxa have remained relatively unchanged for very long periods of time ( Table 8.2 ). Evi- dence from the fossil record demonstrates that many families persist, even if only as one or two genera. Cycads, for example, still thrive presently in Australia, Africa, and Mexico, ap- proximately 100 million years aft er they lost out competitively to angiosperms ( Knoll, 1984 ). Some living cycads are morphologically indistinguishable from fossil taxa dating as far back as the Triassic ( Hermsen et al ., 2009 ), suggesting exceptional morphological stasis over mil- lions of years. Looks can be deceiving, however, as some recent molecular phylogenetic ana- lyses have dispelled the idea of ‘living fossil species’ by demonstrating that all extant cycad species, despite having a deep evolutionary root, are comparatively young, having radiated around 7 million years ago with the modern grasses ( Nagalingum et al ., 2011 ). Th is helps to explain why some aspects of cycad biology, such as stomatal function ( Haworth et al ., 2012 ), is more like the modern grasses with which they co-radiated but many other aspects of their biology have remained seemingly unchanged from their ancient cycad ancestors all the way back in the Permian over 300 million years ago ( Chapter 5 , Section 5.2 ). 08-WillisandMcElwain-Chap08.indd 28808-WillisandMcElwain-Chap08.indd 288 11/28/13 2:25 PM11/28/13 2:25 PM 289 8.4 EVIDENCE FOR PERSISTENCE IN THE PLANT FOSSIL RECORD One of the classic examples of plant persistence in the fossil record is that of the Gink- goales ( Figure 8.19 ). Approximately 250 years ago Ginkgo biloba was introduced into Britain (1758), having been known in cultivation in Japan since 1690 ( Giff ord and Foster, 1989 ; Crane, 2013). Ginkgoales have a fossil record extending back to the early Permian (~280 Ma) and diverse ginkgoalean species were abundant in Triassic and Jurassic vegeta- tion, especially in the northern hemisphere ( Figure 5.9 ). Estimates suggest that there were at least 16 diff erent genera of Mesozoic (248–65 Ma) Ginkgoales ( Pearson, 1995 ). By the end of the early Cretaceous (~100 Ma), however, the global distribution of Ginkgoales became greatly reduced, probably due to radiation of the angiosperms. A rapid decline in the number of species and genera occurred, such that by the middle Eocene, only a few species, including Ginkgo biloba , survived. Ginkgoales have therefore persisted in the fossil record for at least 280 million years, and even though other groups, especially the angiosperms, have drastically restricted their geographical range, Ginkgo biloba still remains viable as a taxon.

Th e discovery of a population of over 250 adults of Takhtajania perrieri , for example, the only extant African/Madagascan representative of the family Winteraceae ( Schatz et al ., 1998 ), suggests that this family, and even possibly the species (from pollen evidence), has persisted for approximately 120 million years ( Table 8.2 ) and are still going strong. 8.5 Adaptations of plants for persistence through intervals of environmental change Many of the characteristics that have enabled plants to persist relatively unchanged in the fossil record over long periods of time are the same as those that are thought to have conferred resistance to the environmental changes associated with faunal mass extinction events. Th ese characteristics include hybridity, polyploidy, asexual reproduction, and persis- tence and dormancy of propagules. Hybridity Hybridization is the crossing of two individuals of dissimilar genetic constitution (i.e. the individual produced is from genetically diff erent species or genera). Th e advantages of this process to both the continuation of a population and the evolution of new species are nu- merous. First, since hybrids recombine the characteristics of their parents, they contain new genetic combinations. In a changing environment such hybrids may potentially be better or pre-adapted to the new suite of environmental conditions than either of the parent plants. Th e characteristics of a population of hybrids may then become stabilized if they are better adapted to the new environmental conditions than either of the parents, and the continu- ation of the population, even if in a slightly altered genetic state, occurs. In many plant species, hybridization is thus an important evolutionary mechanism, where the recombination of genetic material results in development of more resilient taxa that can grow in diverse habitats ( Stebbins, 1959 ). Th is has been demonstrated in a number of extant species, including Eucalyptus (eucalypt), Quercus (oak), Arctostaphylos (bearberry), and Ceanothus (mountain lilac) ( Raven et al ., 1992 ). Extant populations of Ceanothus , for example, grow in a number of diff erent ecological niches on the west coast of North America ( Figure 8.20 ). Two widespread and distinct species of mountain lilac Figure 8.19 Extant and fossil Ginkgoales. Ginkgo biloba Ginkgoites Baiera Sphenobaiera Modern Fossil 08-WillisandMcElwain-Chap08.indd 29008-WillisandMcElwain-Chap08.indd 290 11/28/13 2:25 PM11/28/13 2:25 PM 2918.5 ADAPTATIONS OF PLANTS FOR PERSISTENCE THROUGH ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE exist in this region, the coastal Ceanothus gloriosus and the interior Ceanothus cuneatus . However, there are also three hybrid populations from these two original species, each representing a stable hybrid population, that show improved growth in their own region compared to either parent from which they arose. Th ere are also numerous examples of intergeneric hybridization, i.e. where hybridization has occurred between diff erent gen- era. Although this is much rarer, since diff erent genera are genetically and phenotypi- cally more divergent than diff erent species, extant examples include the shrubs Purshia tridentata and Cowania stansburiana ( Strutz and Th omas, 1964 ; Niklas, 1997 ). Th ese have combined to form a hybrid called Purshia glandulosa , which is genetically and phenotypi- cally distinct. One of the problems with hybridization, however, lies in the fact that many hybrids are sterile. Th is is because the chromosomes of the parent species of some hybrids are not homologous and are therefore unable to pair up during meiosis. An oft en-cited example from the animal kingdom is the cross between horse and donkey, which has produced the mule. Th e mule, although renowned as a pack animal, is sterile and cannot in eff ect form a stable hybrid population through sexual reproduction. Plants have a major advantage over animals in this respect, in that they have at least two mechanisms to override hybrid- induced sterility, namely polyploidy and vegetative (asexual) reproduction. Th us, even if the fi rst generation is partially sterile, full fertility is oft en achieved in later hybrid generations ( Rieseberg, 1995 ). Th ese two mechanisms are discussed in the next sections.

Th ese occur either as the result of a ‘mistake’ in mitosis or meiosis, where there is a mu- tation in chromosome number (‘autopolyploidy’) ( Figure 8.21 a), or where two diff erent spe- cies successfully mate to produce tetraploid off spring containing sets of chromosomes from both parents (‘allopolyploidy’) ( Figure 8.21 b). Polyploidy therefore can result in whole genome duplication. Polyploid plants occur in many natural populations and especially among fl ower- ing plant families (angiosperms) and ferns. It is estimated, for example, that between 60–70 per cent of fl owering plants have a polyploidy ancestry ( Masterson, 1994 ; Cui et al ., 2006 ), a feature that is apparent in the number of extant even-numbered chromosomal plants (because ge- nome doubling always generates an even number of chromosomes) ( Otto, 2007 ) ( Figure  8.22 ). In contrast, polyploidy is relatively rare amongst animals although there are hundreds of in- sects and vertebrate species that are polyploid ( Table 8.3 ). Th e advantages of polyploidy to the evolution and long-term persistence of a population are many (for reviews see Comai, 2005 ; van de Peer et al ., 2009 ; Fawcett and van de Peer, 2010 ) but the key features are as follows: 1. If polyploids arise from chromosome doubling in sterile diploid hybrids, the doubling of chromosome number implies that ‘spare’ chromosomes become available for normal pairing and can restore fertility to the sterile hybrids. 2. New species can evolve through polyploidy through self-fertilization or asexual repro- duction without the requirement of a geographic barrier and within the home range of the parent species. For example, when polyploid members of a population interbreed, they will produce tetraploid off spring. When these off spring reproduce, they will produce fertile tetra- ploid progeny that are genetically isolated from the rest of the population. Th us, within a single generation there is a barrier to gene fl ow between the new species and its parent species without the involvement of any geographical isolation ( Stebbins, 1971 ; Briggs and Walters, 1984 ; Niklas, 1997 ). Both of these features are important for sympatric speciation and may well account for evidence in the fossil record for genome duplications being associated with marked and sudden increases in species richness ( Soltis et al ., 2009 ; van de Peer et al ., 2009 ). 3. In polyploid plants, there is gene redundancy, thus harmful recessive alleles are more likely to be masked by normal dominant alleles. As a result, mutations are less likely to be expressed, plants are more likely to be resistant, and the phenotypic variability in the popula- tions is likely to be low ( Price, 1996 ). Th is protective eff ect of polyploidy against deleterious genes might be important in conditions when there is genetic bottlenecking (e.g. during an interval of environmental disturbance resulting in large-scale reduction in population size) – which can result in inbreeding and emergence of deleterious genes. Polyploidy can protect against this genetic, toxicity ( Comai, 2005 ). 4. Polyploid plants have a greater store of genetic variability (because there are more al- leles at any one locus), and thus adaptation to cope in environmental extremes will be greater. Studies of extant populations, for example, have demonstrated that polyploid species are more widely distributed geographically and occur at habitat margins more frequently than their non-polyploid parents, and there is a high frequency of polyploidy plants in harsh en- vironments ( Grant, 1971 ; Brochmann et al ., 2004 ; Fawcett and van de Peer, 2010 ). 08-WillisandMcElwain-Chap08.indd 29208-WillisandMcElwain-Chap08.indd 292 11/28/13 2:25 PM11/28/13 2:25 PM 2938.5 ADAPTATIONS OF PLANTS FOR PERSISTENCE THROUGH ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE Figure 8.21 Diagrammatic representation of polyploidy in plants, where cells or individuals have two or more sets of chromosomes. These are either the result of a ‘mistake’ in mitosis, where the chromosomes divide but the nucleus does not, thereby producing tetraploid cells (a), or where two different species successfully mate to produce tetraploid offspring containing sets of chromosomes from both parents (b).

It is extremely common in plants and is thought to have been a crucial process in promoting the long-term persistence of vascular plants ( Tiff ney and Niklas, 1985 ; Traverse, 1988a ; Niklas, 1997 ). Asexual reproduction in plants may involve the development of a new individual from an unfertilized egg, thus leading to seed formation without fertilization by pollen, or the production of individuals from somatic cells, i.e. cells not related to gametes. All individuals that are derived by uniparental or vegetative repro- duction, known as clones, contain exactly the same genetic make-up as the parent plant ( Price and Marshall, 1999 ). Clonal growth in plants may be divided into two types ( sensu Tiff ney and Niklas, 1985 ), namely non-linked or linked. Non-linked clones arise where the clones may be dispersed beyond the parent plant by biotic or abiotic vectors. Th ese non- linked structures include bulbs, whole plants, and unfertilized seeds. Linked clones remain attached to the parent plant and are ‘dispersed’ by growth of parent root or branch. Linked structures include rhizomes, root and basal suckering, branch arching (stolons), and liana habits. Although these structures are initially attached to the parent plant, severance eventu- ally leads to them becoming physiologically separate individuals. Th ere are at least two aspects of asexual reproduction that are thought to have been advanta- geous to the survival of plant species spanning faunal mass extinction boundaries. First, it provides another means by which sterile plants (e.g. certain hybrids) may still become widespread and per- sist, both spatially and temporally. Secondly, vegetative reproduction in many plants is a mechan- ism to cope with stress. For instance, many plants will regenerate vegetatively aft er trauma, such as Figure 8.22 Proportion of polyploid species observed in ferns, monocots, and eudicots as evidenced by a saw-toothed pattern in the distribution of chromosome numbers with a high preponderance of even over odd. Polyploidization always generates an even number of chromosomes. The number of species sampled and proportion of those sampled with evidence of a past polyploidization event are shown.

Th is therefore enables plants to persist even during periods of adverse environmental conditions and even possibly disease. Estimates for the presence of clonal versus aclonal plants in the fossil record ( Tiff ney and Niklas, 1985 ) have revealed some interesting trends ( Figure 8.23 ). In general it would ap- pear that when the environment has been favourable (here ‘favourability’ is determined by higher levels of atmospheric moisture), for example, during the Carboniferous (354–290 Ma), mid-Mesozoic (220–200 Ma), and early Tertiary (65–40 Ma), aclonal forms increased. In contrast, when the environment became more arid, for example in the late Permian and early Triassic (256–242 Ma) and from the Miocene through to the Quaternary (23.8–0 Ma), clonal forms increased. Th is apparent success of clonal forms during periods of increased aridity may indicate either the relative benefi ts of asexual reproduction and/or the benefi ts of a prostrate growth form (which is usually associated with the clonal form) during times of environmental aridity. It is also interesting to note that presently within the angiosperms, monocotyledon families tend to be dominated by clonal growth (especially the grasses), whereas Eudicots tend to be dominated by aclonal forms. Vegetative reproduction is thought to have been an important strategy of survival in the recovery period aft er the Permian–Triassic mass extinction event. Th ere is evidence based on spores and macrofossils that a group of giant lycopsids, Pleuromeia , proliferated and underwent a major radiation post boundary ( Retallack, 1995 ; Looy et al ., 1999 ).

Many seeds have the potential to go into long periods of dormancy in soil seed banks and still retain their viability for at least 100 years ( Kivilaan and Bandurski, 1981 ; Bewley and Black, 1982 ). Such a long ‘resting phase’ would probably be of suffi cient duration to survive the worst of the environmental catastrophes caused by, for example, a meteorite impact. Th ere are also examples of seeds extracted from sub-fossil sediments that have retained their viability for over a millenium. For example, over two-thirds of seeds recovered from a lake bed in the Liaoning Province, China, and dated to between 1200 and 330 years old ( Shen-Miller et al ., 1995 ) have been germinated, growing into robust living plants of sacred lotus ( Nelumbo nucifera ). It is suggested in this example that certain morphophysiological characteristics of fruits of the sacred lotus make them particularly adapted for longevity. Th ese include impervious and mechanically strong fruit walls, the fact that they contain a protein-repair enzyme, high levels of reducing ele- ments in embryonic axes, and the ability to maintain membrane fl uidity ( Shen-Miller et al ., 1995 ). Th e preservational environment, however, is also important, and it is suggested that the highly reducing anoxic environment of the sediments from which these fruits were obtained would have contributed to their exceptional longevity. It would therefore appear that a large number of extant plant groups contain genera that have persisted for millions of years, as a result of one, or a combination, of these intriguing mechanisms. Such persistent mechanisms must be viewed as features that in many ways distinguish plants from other organisms and have guaranteed against the comparatively ‘rapid blanket extinctions’ ( Leopold, 1967 ; Knoll, 1984 ; Traverse, 1988a ). If there is no mass extinction in the plant fossil record, a view that is consistent with the current evidence, and plants can persist for millions of years, then what, if anything, is driving plant macroevolu- tion? Th is question will be addressed in Chapter 9 . Summary 1. Mass extinctions are characterized by the relatively rapid extinction of groups of organisms, usually at a high taxonomic level, that is families and even orders, and when Earth loses up to three-quarters of its species in a geologically short interval of time. 2. At least fi ve big mass extinction events have been recognized in the marine faunal record, with similar trends among terrestrial faunas for at least three of these. 3. Th e evidence for similar mass extinctions in the plant fossil record is ambiguous. 4. At the Frasnian–Famennian boundary (372 Ma) over half the marine genera present on Earth did not survive. Th e plant fossil record at this time indicates an increase in turnover but there is no evidence for widespread extinction among many diverse higher taxa of terrestrial plants. 5. Th e mass extinction event at the end of the Permian (252 Ma) has been termed the ‘mother of mass extinctions’. Up to 96 per cent of all durable skeletonized marine 08-WillisandMcElwain-Chap08.indd 29608-WillisandMcElwain-Chap08.indd 296 11/28/13 2:25 PM11/28/13 2:25 PM 297SUMMARY invertebrate species went extinct. In the plant fossil record major ecological upheaval and turnover was apparent in all regions, with mass migrational shift s ( Rees et al ., 2000 ). Additionally there was a marked decline in the level of plant family survivorship but evidence for the rapid global extinction of large numbers of plant families is not apparent. In this sense the fl oral fossil record is at odds with the faunal record at the end Permian. 6. Th e Triassic–Jurassic boundary (201 Ma) marks the third greatest faunal extinction event in Earth history. In the plant fossil record, similar to the end-Permian, there is evidence for massive ecological upheaval, migrations, range shift s, and adaptation by plants at this boundary. Th is resulted in extinctions with up to 85 per cent of species becoming locally to regionally extinct across North America, Greenland, and Europe. However, despite abundant evidence for major ecological upheaval, only a single plant family went globally extinct: the Peltaspermaceae seed ferns. 7. Th e Cretaceous–Palaeogene boundary (66 Ma) is the most widely known of the ‘big fi ve’ mass extinction events due to the extinction of dinosaurs, along with an 80 per cent extinction of marine invertebrate species and a drastic reduction of mammalian species. However, similar to the other mass extinction events, evidence for a global mass extinction of plants of a magnitude similar to that seen in the faunal record is ambiguous. Th ere is certainly evidence for widespread fl oristic change associated with ecological trauma including the rise in abundance of fossil ferns thought to indicate rapid re-vegetation aft er widespread wildfi res. However, the scale and extent of trauma suff ered by vegetation was by no means global. Where there was extinction apparent, the pattern of those plants that went extinct appears to have been highly selective in both space and clade. In fact few to no fl owering plant families were lost and species diversity recovered in all regions—even though this took up to 1 Ma. 8. Th ere does not therefore appear to be strong evidence for comparatively rapid blanket mass extinctions in the fossil plant record comparable to those seen in the fossil faunal records. 9. Reasons for the lack of mass extinction in the fossil plant record are probably closely related to the mechanisms that enable plants to withstand a certain amount of environmental stress. Th ese include hybridity, polyploidy, asexual reproduction, and persistence and dormancy of propagules. 08-WillisandMcElwain-Chap08.indd 29708-WillisandMcElwain-Chap08.indd 297 11/28/13 2:25 PM11/28/13 2:25 PM 9 Evolutionary theories and the plant fossil record Molecular and morphological studies of both living and fossil plants have made huge inroads in our understanding of evolution since Darwin proposed the theory of natural selection ( Darwin, 1859 ). However, the majority of macroevolutionary theory, which seeks to defi ne and explain the course and tempo of large-scale patterns in evolution, has been based almost exclusively on evidence from the animal kingdom, with only a handful of notable exceptions ( see Stebbins, 1950 , 1974 ; Grant, 1963 ; Chaloner, 1967 , 1970 ; Banks, 1968 , 1970 ; Knoll, 1984 , 2001 ; Niklas et al ., 1985a , b ; Traverse, 1988a , b ; Bennett, 1997 ; Niklas, 1997 ). Th is fi nal chapter attempts to redress this balance by outlining a number of the main evolutionary theories, which are very much part of current and lively debate (e.g. Dawkins, 2006 ; Gould, 1998 ), and to examine them in light of the plant fossil record described throughout this book. 9.1 Evolutionary theories Phyletic gradualism ( Darwin, 1859 ) Th e theory that is now termed ‘phyletic gradualism’ was proposed originally by Charles Darwin back in 1859. It is based on the principle that evolutionary change results from descent with modifi cation and is accomplished by means of a process termed ‘natural se- lection’. Species are therefore temporary stages in continuing gradual change. Ecological interactions visible today are the ultimate driving force behind macroevolution. Phyletic gradualism thus supports the view that speciation is a gradual and continuous process and ‘if variations useful to any organic being do occur, individuals thus characterised will have the best chance of being preserved in the struggle for life; and from the strong principle of inheritance they will tend to produce off spring similarly characterized’ ( Darwin, 1859 ). A diagrammatic representation of this theory (the only diagram in Darwin’s book) indicates a cone of increasing diversity ( Figure 9.1 a), broadening out from a single trunk at the base to numerous branches at the top, thus representing continuously increasing morphology and diversity through time. Inherent in this theory is the assumption that present day ecosys- tems are the most diverse and morphologically adapted in geological time ( Bennett, 1997 ). With increasing scientifi c knowledge, especially with regard to processes of isolation (both 09-WillisandMcElwain-Chap09.indd 29809-WillisandMcElwain-Chap09.indd 298 11/28/13 1:19 PM11/28/13 1:19 PM 2999.1 EVOLUTIONARY THEORIES geographic and genetic) and genetic inheritance, many embellishments have been added to this theory (see, for example, Mayr, 1954 , 1963 ; Dawkins, 2006 ). Punctuated equilibrium ( Eldredge and Gould, 1972 ) Th e theory of punctuated equilibrium was fi rst proposed by Eldredge and Gould in 1972 . It was based on their observation that the geological record does not indicate a long sequence of continuous intermediate species from the parental to the new (descendant) species (which would be expected if phyletic gradualism was occurring), but rather there are long periods where there appears to be little morphological change or speciation, followed by periods of relatively rapid change. Historically, this pattern of abrupt speciation in the geological re- cord had been attributed to gaps in the fossil record. Eldredge and Gould argued, however, that this assumption was unsafe and rather that the ‘breaks’ could represent periods of rapid speciation. Th us, they envisaged a phyletic line that was usually in stasis and disturbed only rarely by rapid and episodic events of speciation ( Price, 1996 ). A diagrammatic representa- tion of the punctuated equilibrium theory ( Figure 9.1 b) thus indicates a cone of increasing diversity, but this time with vertical branches representing periods of stasis, interspersed by horizontal lines representing periods of rapid change. In recent years the theory of punctuated equilibrium has been further developed to in- corporate the suggestion that mass extinctions (physically or biologically mediated) are the punctuating events leading to the apparent sudden speciation events. It is proposed that mass extinctions eff ectively wipe the slate clean by clearing away the accumulated evolution of a particular lineage, and thereby allow a new lineage to evolve rapidly to fi ll the niche Figure 9.1 Diagrammatic representation of (a) Phyletic gradualism (sensu Darwin, 1859 ), where speciation is a gradual and continuous process. This is indicated by a cone of increasing diversity broadening out from a single trunk at the base to numerous branches at the top, thus representing continuously increasing morphology and diversity through time. (b) Punctuated equilibrium ( sensu Eldredge and Gould, 1972 ), where there are relatively rapid periods of speciation interspersed by long periods where there appears to be little morphological change or speciation, referred to as stasis. This is indicated by a cone of increasing diversity, but with vertical branches representing periods of stasis, interspersed by horizontal lines representing periods of rapid change.

Th us, Gould argued that evolutionary time is a hierarchical system of distinct tiers ( Table 9.1 ), with mass extinctions representing the ultimate driving mechanism behind macroevolution. Many others before Eldredge and Gould had noted long periods of stasis in the fossil record, including, for example, Lyell in 1856 (cited in Bennett, 1997 ) and, indeed, Darwin himself commented that ‘it is far more probable that each form remains for long periods unaltered, and then again undergoes modifi cation’. However, the idea of stasis being punc- tuated by ‘rapid periods’ of change was new, as was the concept that mass extinctions were the ultimate driving force. Th e theory of punctuated equilibrium has now become a well- established alternative to the model of phyletic gradualism in the evolutionary debate, and has led some to go as far as to suggest that ‘natural selection seems to provide little more than fi ne material and fi ne adjustment to large-scale evolution’ ( Stanley, 1975 ). Th e debate remains lively, however, as to which of these two modes of evolution, gradualism or punctuation and stasis, predominates in the fossil record. A survey of 58 studies investigating whether speciation in the fossil record predominantly conformed to phyletic gradualism or punctuated equilibrium concluded that ‘paleontological evi- dence overwhelmingly supports a view that speciation is sometimes gradual and some- times punctuated and that no one mode characterizes this very complicated process in the history of life’ ( Erwin and Anstey, 1995 ). It is interesting to note that not a single study included in this comprehensive review was based on the plant fossil record. How does the fossil plant record or molecular phylogenetic studies fi t into either of these two evolutionary theories? Th e existence of ‘living fossils’, such as Ginkgo and cycads, which show remarkable morphological ‘stasis’ since the Jurassic (~200 Ma), would seem to support partially the theory of punctuated equilibrium ( Chapter 8 ). In terms of the mode of speciation, however, too few studies have addressed this issue in the plant fossil record. Molecular phylogenetic studies involving lineage through time analysis and molecular clock approaches support the idea of rapid bursts of speciation in very short time intervals for many angiosperm lineages (e.g. Wang et al ., 2009 ; Chapter 6 ). Rapid busts of speciation among angiosperms have also been invoked following whole genome duplication events in the early Cretaceous (e.g. Chapter 8 ; Van de Peer et al ., 2009a ; Fawcett et al ., 2009 ; Fawcett and Van de Peer, 2010 ). Not all angiosperm lineages, however, conform to this mode of evolution; for instance the Palm clade, which is a highly species-rich member of modern tropical everwet forests, does not show any evidence for rapid or punctuated speciation events but rather has diversifi ed gradually over the past 120 million years ( Couvreur et al ., 2011 ; Chapter 7 ). Th ere are currently no examples of studies on punctuated equilibrium, using fossil plants, that stand up to the rigorous set of criteria required (see review in Gould, 2000 ) to really test the theory. Table 9.1 Temporal hierarchy of dominant processes controlling evolutionary patterns seen in the geological record (after Gould, 1985 ). First tier Microevolutionary processes, e.g. competition Evolutionary events of the ecological moment Second tier Punctuated events, e.g. orbital variations Trends with lineages over geological time Third tier Mass extinctions Mass extinction 09-WillisandMcElwain-Chap09.indd 30009-WillisandMcElwain-Chap09.indd 300 11/28/13 1:19 PM11/28/13 1:19 PM 3019.2 PATTERNS OF EVOLUTIONARY CHANGE IN THE PLANT FOSSIL RECORD Irrespective of the mode of speciation, are there any large-scale macroevolutionary pat- terns observable in the plant fossil record? In a hierarchical scheme ( sensu Gould, 1985 ), mass extinctions are the ultimate driving mechanism behind macroevolution in the animal kingdom. It was established in Chapter 8 , however, that plants do not undergo rapid global mass extinction at generic or family level (although they do demonstrate high species ex- tinction/turnover and likely opportunities for speciation post boundary). If this is the case, what is the pattern and timing of major originations and extinction in the plant fossil record? Does plant evolution as represented in the fossil record indicate a trend of increasing total species diversity through time, or decimation of species numbers followed by renewed di- versifi cation? Are major origination events concentrated in certain intervals of time or do they occur evenly spaced throughout the evolutionary history of plants? Are there other driving mechanisms of large-scale patterns of plant evolution that are discernible? And how do theories of macroevolution tie in with what is known of the molecular record—do the forces that determine microevolution have any bearing on macroevolution? 9.2 Patterns of evolutionary change in the plant fossil record Surprisingly few studies have examined data from the plant fossil record in terms of overall evolutionary patterns through geological time. However, those records that have attempted a synthesis, based on species-level compilations of originations and extinctions, broadly agree on the overall patterns of plant diversifi cation ( Chaloner, 1967 , 1970 ; Banks, 1968 , 1970 ; Knoll et al ., 1979 ; Niklas and Pratt, 1980 ; Niklas et al ., 1983 ; Lidgard and Crane, 1988 ; Crane and Lidgard, 1989 ; Edwards and Davies, 1990 ; Tiff ney and Niklas, 1990 ; Kovach and Batten, 1993 ; Niklas and Tiff ney, 1994 ; Niklas, 1997 ; Lupia et al ., 1999 , 2000 ). From the fi rst appearance of terrestrial vascular plants approximately 430 million years ago (Silurian), the plant fossil record demonstrates a trend of increasing total species diversity through geological time ( Niklas et al ., 1983 ; Niklas and Tiff ney, 1994 ). Four major plant groups, each with common structural characteristics and/or reproductive strategies, have successively dominated the terrestrial fl ora ( Figure 9.2 ). Th e fi rst major group includes the earliest non-vascular and vascular plants, which originated approximately 475 (Ordovician) and 430 (Silurian) million years ago, respectively. Th ese were superseded by the next two major groups or ‘reproductive grades’, the pteridophytes and gymnosperms, which originated in the late Devonian around 390 Ma. Th e pteridophytes include the spore-producing plants (lycopsids, fi licopsids, sphenopsids, progymnosperms) and the gymnosperms include the earliest seed plants (cordaites and pteridosperms), conifers, cycads, bennettites, Gnetales, and ginkgos. Th e last major reproductive innovation and radiation was that of the angiosperms in the Cretaceous, from approximately 140 Ma. With the adaptive radiation of each new reproductive grade, a gradual decline in the previous grade occurred ( Figure 9.2 ). Th ere is, as yet, no evidence for large-scale reductions in family diversity in the plant fossil record comparable to that seen in the faunal record and classifi ed as mass extinction (with the possible exception of the Permian–Triassic boundary, ~250 Ma; see Chapter 8 ). Various studies on rates of change in total species-level diversity through geological time are also in broad agreement (e.g. Niklas et al ., 1985a , b ; Crane and Lidgard, 1989 ; Kovach 09-WillisandMcElwain-Chap09.indd 30109-WillisandMcElwain-Chap09.indd 301 11/28/13 1:19 PM11/28/13 1:19 PM 302 9 EVOLUTIONARY THEORIES AND THE PLANT FOSSIL RECORD and Batten, 1993 ; Niklas, 1997 ). Th ese compilations provide a means to investigate the tempo of plant evolution, and indicate that following the origination of each new repro- ductive group or ‘evolutionary fl ora’, each group radiated, as revealed by an overall rise in total species number and increased species turnover rate (where the fossil record indicates more originations than extinctions) ( Figure 9.2 ). It is interesting to note that the evolution of grasses, approximately 70 million years ago ( Chapter 7 ), also occurred during a period of increased species turnover. With the radiation of each new group the speciation rates were initially very high and then decreased to a low baseline ( Figure 9.2 ). Th us, the plant fossil record appears to indicate periods of rapid speciation and associated increases in species diversity, followed by a plateauing and then a decline ( Niklas et al ., 1983 ; Niklas and Tiff ney, 1994 ; Niklas, 1997 ). Th is pattern is also supported by molecular phylogenetic data and lineage through time analyses (e.g. Fawcett et al ., 2009 ; Jiao et al ., 2011 ). Furthermore, although the radiation of each new ‘evolutionary fl ora’ resulted in incremental increases in total species number, the diversity of the group being replaced (e.g. the gymnosperms by the angiosperms) then declined.

It could be argued, however, that this low baseline has yet to be seen in the angiosperms, since overall species numbers are still increasing and have yet to plateau. At the broadest scale, therefore, the overall pattern of plant evolution appears to be con- centrated in distinct intervals in geological time ( Figure 9.3 ) rather than evenly or randomly spread throughout the geological record. Changes in total plant species diversity have oc- curred during relatively short intervals of geological time, interspersed by longer periods of relative stasis and plateaus in species diversity ( Figure 9.2 ). With the exception of the late Permian, the peaks of plant extinctions seen in the plant fossil record do not appear to match those seen in the animal record, which peak at the ‘big fi ve’ mass extinction boundaries ( Figure 9.3 , Chapter 8 ). Equally, peaks in plant origination do not correspond with those of the animal record, which tend to reach their maxima following mass extinction events ( Figure 9.3 ). If mass extinction events are not the macroevolutionary driver of land plants, then can an alternative?

Vermeij ( 2006 ) defi nes an evolutionary innovation as ‘a newly evolved structure or condition that enables its phylogenetic derived bearer to perform a new function or that improves its bearer’s performance materially in an already established function’. At fi rst glance it appears from Figure 9.3 that the timing of reproductive innovations can explain the ‘big picture’ timing of clade replacements in the fossil record; spore-bearing plants (pteridophytes) are replaced by gymnosperms following the origin of the seed and gymnosperms are eventually replaced by angiosperms following the origin of the angiosperm carpel and fl ower ( Figure 9.2 ). Th is macroevolutionary explanation is not entirely satisfactory, however, because if you consider all of the key morphological and physiological innovations that defi ne the basic body plan of most living plants, e.g. roots, leaves, xylem, phloem, stomata, cuticle, etc., their fi rst appearance in the fossil record does not consistently coincide with peaks in plant speciation or extinction ( Figure 9.4 ). Key morphological and physiological innovations in the plant fossil record and as evidenced in the molecular record (e.g. Boyce, 2010 ; Pires and Dolan, 2012 ) are not randomly distributed over the past 450 million years, but concentrated tightly into the fi rst 90 million years of land plant evolution and the last 140 million ( Figure 9.4 ). Figure 9.4 Range chart illustrating the earliest known occurrence of key morphological (grey) and physiological (white) innovations/novelties in the plant fossil record. Over 70 per cent of these innovations occurred within the ﬁ rst ~90 million years of land plant evolution. 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500Millions of years ago S por e (homospory) Cuticle Kidne y stomata X ylem Rhizoids R oots Ph l o e m S p or e (heter ospory) Pr e pollen Seed Wo o d Lea v es Flower Carpel CAM photos ynthesis ?

Th is suggests that morphological complexity in land plants was not attained gradually but was also concentrated into relatively short intervals of time. It also suggests that evolution of morphological novelty alone is not suffi cient to drive macroevolutionary change. We have seen repeated examples throughout the book that in order for an evolutionary innovation to confer a competitive advantage, there has to be ecological opportunity, the environmental conditions have to be appropriate, and there can be no developmental constraint ( Figure 9.5 ). For example, the evolution of true megaphyll leaves is thought to have been developmentally possible well before taxa with true leaves became a widespread phenomenon throughout the globe ( Donoghue, 2005 ). It was only when atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations reached suffi ciently low levels that an en- vironmental constraint on leaf development was lift ed ( Beerling et al ., 2001 ) and the novelty of a leaf conferred an advantage to its bearer ( Chapter 4 ). Angiosperms evolved a suite of evolutionary innovations including high leaf vein density ( Boyce et al . 2009 ; Feild et al . 2011 ; Chapter 6 ) and rapid fertilization times ( Williams, 2008 ) to name just two, which conferred a physiological and a reproductive advantage, respectively, compared with their gymnosperm ancestors. Yet it still took millions of years for angiosperms to gain ecological dominance over gymnosperms in most world biomes. Th ere is also a considerable time lag between origin of the suite of novelties that defi ne angiosperms as a group and peak plant speciation rate in the plant fossil record ( Figure 9.4 ). Th is time lag suggests that extrinsic factors (e.g. environmental change) as well as intrinsic (evolutionary innovations) played an important role in macroevolutionary pattern.

Some of the earliest evidence for whole genome duplication comes from the fossil record ( Masterson, 1994 ) and a recent investigation of species that have had their whole genomes sequenced has shown that an astoundingly high proportion underwent whole genome duplication around the time of the Cretaceous–Palaeogene mass extinction event, 66 million years ago ( Fawcett et al ., 2009 ; Van de Peer et al ., 2009a ; Fawcett and Van de Peer 2010 ). Th ese observa- tions have led to the suggestion that whole genome duplication within (autopolyploidy) or between (allopolyploidy) species may be responsible for accelerated speciation rates in plant evolution and thus a possible macroevolutionary driver ( Figure 9.6 ). Doubling the compliment of chromosomes within a plant genome provides: (a) a ‘back- up’ system of functionally and developmentally important genes; (b) a larger than normal Figure 9.6 Rapid radiation events in land plant evolution (indicated in grey on evolutionary tree) are often preceded by whole genome duplication events (indicated by black bars).

In Chapter 8 we examined how polyploidization could enable plant lineages to persist through the environmental changes that characterize mass extinction events in Earth history ( Section 8.5 ). Th e same set of attributes that enabled polyploids to survive mass extinction may also have provided them with a means to re-vegetate the post-extinction landscape. Whole genome duplication (WGD) events were therefore probably a very im- portant driver of plant evolution, not only for angiosperms but also the whole seed plant clade ( Figure 9.6 ). Th ere is evidence to suggest that gene duplication events were intensely concentrated around 319 and 192 million years ago, implicating two WGDs in ancestral lineages shortly before the diversifi cation of extant seed plants and extant angiosperms, respectively ( Jiao et al ., 2011 ). Lycopods and ferns are also very prone to WGD. It is estimated, for example, that among ferns, 31 per cent of speciation events have involved polyploidization, although less is currently known about the temporal patterns of polyploidy events in these groups ( McGrath and Lynch, 2012 ). It has been argued, however, that for polyploids to be ecologi- cally more successful than their diploid ancestors, major environmental perturbations were re- quired ( Otto, 2007 ). Whole genome duplication may provide clues to the genetic mechanism underlying bursts rather than gradual speciation in the plant fossil record but an ultimate environmental driver is also required to either increase the prevalence of whole genome duplication events occurring within and between species or to increase the likelihood of polyploidy conferring ecological success. In Section 9.3 possible candidates for long-term environmental change are explored. 9.3 The mechanisms driving evolutionary change Is it possible to identify specifi c climatic and environmental events that may be responsible for major evolutionary changes seen in the plant fossil record? And at what scale (time and space) do these events have to be, in order to bring about major evolutionary change in the plant kingdom? Pulses of environmental change In the literature, the idea that changes in the environment may account for evolutionary change has warranted much discussion. Regardless of whether these changes are gradual or punctuated, it has long been argued that changes in the environment are largely responsible for the radiation and extinction of taxa ( Barnosky, 2001 ; Barnosky et al ., 2004 ; Knoll, 1991 ; Jackson and Erwin, 2006 ) and perhaps even the timing of appearance of evolutionary novel- ties or innovations ( Fawcett et al ., 2009 ; Van de Peer et al ., 2009a ). Th ese ideas have also been incorporated into the theory of punctuated equilibrium ( Vrba 1985 , 1993 , 1995 ) to develop the so-called ‘turnover-pulse’ hypothesis. Th e turnover-pulse hypothesis builds on the ideas put forward by Eldredge and Gould ( 1972 ) to suggest that evolution is normally conservative and speciation does not occur 09-WillisandMcElwain-Chap09.indd 30709-WillisandMcElwain-Chap09.indd 307 11/28/13 1:19 PM11/28/13 1:19 PM 308 9 EVOLUTIONARY THEORIES AND THE PLANT FOSSIL RECORD unless forced by changes in the physical environment. Th is hypothesis therefore supports the concept of punctuated equilibrium but takes it one step further to suggest that periods of speciation are largely a function of changes in the physical environment, especially climatic change, possibly of tectonic origin, but most probably of astronomical origin ( Vrba, 1985 , 1993 ) ( Figure 9.7 ). Th e model also proposes that extinction may result directly from climate change or from ecological interactions among newly associated species. Th e ques- tion therefore arises as to whether periods of evolutionary change in the plant record can be related to evidence in the geological record for periods (pulses) of changing environ- mental conditions. Is there a set of environmental conditions particularly associated with the periods of increased originations over extinctions (that is, turnover) in the plant fossil record? Also, how can changes in the physical environment bring about evolutionary change both at the macro and microevolutionary level? At the broadest scale, factors responsible for bringing about major environmental and/or climatic change include orbital variations and plate tectonics. Orbital variations in energy Over geological time, calculations indicate that variations in the Earth’s axial tilt, preces- sion, and changes in the eccentricity of the elliptical orbit around the sun have produced diff erences both in the amount of solar radiation received by the Earth and also in the latitudinal and seasonal distribution of this radiation ( Milankovitch, 1930 ). Th e cyclical nature of these variations, known as Milankovitch cycles, has resulted in large and sig- nifi cant astronomical forcing of the climate at intervals of approximately 400, 100, 41, and 23–19 thousand years ( Imbrie and Imbrie, 1979 ).

Th e reduction of incoming solar radiation induced by variations in the Earth’s orbit ( Laskar et al ., 2004 ) triggers global climatic change, leading to cold-stage conditions and the formation of major ice caps at the poles during some intervals, including the Quater- nary ( Bradley, 1999 ). Th erefore, the Milankovitch cycles have paced numerous warm/cold stages throughout geological history, including, for example, the glacial–interglacial cycles of the Quaternary (the last ~2.6 million years), and the pacing eff ect of these Milankovitch cycles has been proposed as the pulsing mechanism behind punctuated equilibrium ( Bennett, 1990 , 1997 ). It is suggested that the cumulative long-term eff ect of communities becoming split up and isolated during the cold stages, followed by recombination in warm stages, will ultimately lead to speciation and evolution of new lineages ( Bennett, 1997 ; Dynesius and Jansson, 2000 ; Jansson and Dynesius, 2002 ). Small adaptive changes may accumulate during ecological time, but most of these changes will become lost as communities are restored as a result of climatic changes on Milankovitch timescales. Speciation will thus occasionally take place in populations that have become isolated because of perpetual environmental change at Milankovitch timescales ( Table 9.2 ). Some of the most detailed fossil evidence for the impact of Milankovitch cycles upon terrestrial vegetation is contained in pollen records. A record from Bogota in Colombia ( Hooghiemstra, 1989 , 1995 ; Hooghiemstra and Sarmiento, 1991 ) spanning the past 3.5 million years, for example, clearly indicates a strong vegetational response to climatic changes associated with Milankovitch forcing of the climate ( Figure 9.8 ). Th e vegetation on the high plain of Bogota fl uctuated between mixed Andean forest (containing, for ex- ample, species such as Podocarpus , Hedyosmum , Weinmannia, and Myrica ) during the in- terglacials, and subparamo (e.g. Ericaceae, Hypericum , Compositae) or grassparamo (e.g. Poaceae, Valeriana , Caryophyllaceae) during the glacials. A sequence from a crater lake in Hungary, deposited between 3–2.7 million years ago and containing a detailed chronology in well-defi ned yearly layers within the sediment, indicates clear cycles in the vegetation at intervals of approximately 100, 41, and 23–19 thousand years. Th e pollen record from this Hungarian site indicates that in response to orbital variations in insolation, vegeta- tion changed from a forest dominated by subtropical and temperate species to one domi- nated by those types presently found in the northern latitude boreal forests ( Willis et al ., Table 9.2 Temporal hierarchy of dominant processes controlling evolutionary patterns seen in the geological record (from Bennett, 1990 , 1997 ).

Th us, during the cold stages, boreal forest extended south to fi ll the niche occupied by subtropical and temperate species during the warm stages. What this record also demonstrated was that during intervals of large variation in amplitude of the energy, there was a reduction in diversity. In contrast, intervals where there was smaller variation in the amplitude of energy had higher diversity ( Willis et al ., 2007 , 2009 ). Simi- larly, a study looking at latitudinal gradients in the diversity of fl owering plants indicated a correlation between amplitude of the Quaternary climatic oscillations and variation in diversifi cation where low latitudes (that experience a lower amplitude of climatic oscil- lations) accumulated more species than their higher latitude sister families ( Jansson and Davies, 2008 ). What both these studies appear to suggest, therefore, is that climatic stabil- ity is important for diversity and speciation and that during intervals of higher variability in climate (and likewise in regions of greater climatic variability), extinction is the pre- dominant mode. Th us, we should expect to see intervals of diversifi cation during times of relative climatic stability and, on a spatial scale, those regions that provide the greatest continuity of populations despite climatic perturbations should have the highest diversity/ speciation ( Schluter and Weir, 2007 ; Weir and Schluter, 2007 ; Willis et al ., 2009 ). Refugial isolation Th e overall biogeographical eff ects of the alternating cold/warm stages of the Quaternary provides a good analogue for climatic perturbations for other intervals in Earth’s history and has the added advantage of better temporal and spatial resolution to look at the eff ects. Dur- ing the cold stages (glacials) of the Quaternary, the biogeographical evidence indicates that temperate vegetation became isolated into regions where microenvironmentally favourable conditions existed (refugia). It then re-expanded from these regions during the warm stages (interglacials). On a broad global scale, regions such as the Tropics provided important Figure 9.8 Graphical correlation of the tree pollen record spanning the past 1.2 Ma from Funza, on the High Plain, Bogota, with a proxy temperature record obtained from the δ 18 O record from deep ocean core ODP677 ( Shackleton et al ., 1990 ; redrawn from Hooghiemstra, 1995 ). The increase in tree pollen represents mixed Andean forest (containing, for example, species such as Podocarpus , Hedyosmum , Weinmannia , and Myrica ); the increase in shrub and herbaceous pollen representing subparamo (e.g. Ericaceae, Hypericum , Compositae) or grassparamo (e.g. Gramineae, Valeriana , Caryophyllaceae).

In fact, during the 2.6 million years of the Quaternary, plant communities have spent more time in isolation than in the integrated communities of the interglacials ( Willis, 1996 ). Many of the regions that are thought to have been large (e.g. Amazon; Bush, 1994 ) or small refugial areas (e.g. southern Europe; Bennett et al ., 1991 ) during the glacial periods appear to have therefore provided the greatest ‘stability’ for populations during intervals of climatic perturbations and they contain the greatest present-day species diversity ( Willis and Whittaker, 2000 ). At the macroecological scale, these data therefore appear to support the suggestion that long-term isolation has possibly led to diversifi cation and speciation within these regions. Molecular evidence adds further support to this suggestion ( Hewitt, 2000 ). Examination of extant populations of the silver fi r ( Abies alba ) ( Konnert and Bergmann, 1995 ), oak ( Quercus robur ) ( Hewitt, 2004 ), and beech ( Fagus sylvatica ) ( Demesure et al ., 1996 ; Taberlet and Bouvet, 1994 ) in central, southern, and northern Europe, for example, indicates that there is signifi cant genetic diff erentiation between populations relating to their regions of isolation during the last full glacial (between approximately 100 and 15 thousand years ago). In the study of Abies alba , the genetic characteristics of populations were studied throughout central and southern Europe ( Konnert and Bergmann, 1995 ). Th e results indicated that Abies alba was genetically diff erentiated to a high degree in fi ve postu- lated regions, and can be identifi ed as populations with alleles characteristic of the Balkans, northern Italy, southern Italy, southern France, and southern Spain ( Figure 9.11 a).

However, evidence from this study also indicates that in only two of these regions have the populations remained isolated during the current warm stage, namely in Spain and southern Italy. In comparison, populations from the other three regions have colonized central and eastern Europe, creating a large mixed gene pool ( Figure 9.11 b). From an evolutionary viewpoint, therefore, it is only those populations that remain isolated during the warm stages that will carry the genetic diff erentiation on into the next glacial period ( Willis, 1996 ). In terms of isolation, redistribution of communities, and punctuated events, evidence from the fossil record would, therefore, appear to suggest that orbitally induced variations in insolation leading to climatic variations at Milankovitch frequencies are possibly one of the driving mechanisms behind punctuated equilibrium ( Vrba, 1985 , 1995 ; Bennett, 1990 , 1997 ). However, it is not so easy to demonstrate from the fossil record that this process of isolation and redistribution leads to speciation and thus micro and macroevolution ( Willis and Whittaker, 2000 ; Hewitt, 2000 ). Considering the long-term eff ects of isolation and redistribution through multiple gla- cial/interglacial cycles during the Quaternary, the palaeoecological evidence is ambiguous. Th e sequence from Hungary described previously, for example, indicates that the overall long-term eff ect of the continuous warm/cold stages in the 320,000-year interval covered by this section appears to be extinction rather than speciation ( Willis et al ., 1999a , b ). Similarly, if the 3.5 Ma sequence from Bogota is examined, there is a similar overall reduction in spe- cies number with time. In fact, throughout the northern hemisphere, the overall trend of the Quaternary has been one of plant extinction ( Van der Hammen et al ., 1971 ; Tallis, 1991 ; Coxon and Waldren, 1997 ) ( Figure 9.12 ). But it is also questionable whether this really rep- resents extinction, since the majority of plants that have disappeared are still living, but in more southerly latitudes ( Figure 9.12 ) and there are certainly no mass extinctions. It is also questionable, therefore, whether a long-enough time-slice has been considered. Th e major radiations in the plant fossil record occurred over millions of years, whereas Quaternary glaciations barely provide continuous isolation for 2 million years. But what happens over longer timescales? Is there increased speciation in relation to or- bital oscillations at Milankovitch frequencies, or do these eff ects become lost in subsequent interglacials? Geological evidence suggests that the impact of orbital variations on patterns of global climate has varied considerably. At certain periods of the Earth’s history, for exam- ple, there was no build-up of ice at the poles, whereas the impact of global climate change was much more severe at other times. Th e relative impact of the orbital oscillations upon global climate is related to a number of diff erent climatic/geological phenomena ( Frakes et al ., 1992 ). At the broadest scale, the Earth’s climatic history has been categorized into two modes: ‘icehouse’ and ‘greenhouse’ ( Figure 9.13 ) ( Fischer, 1984 ). Th e switch between icehouse/greenhouse modes is on a cycle of approximately 30 million years ( Fischer and Arthur, 1977 ). Th us, the climatic changes apparently controlled by orbital variations at Milankovitch frequencies (i.e. at periods of 400, 100, 41, and 23–19 thousand years) are in eff ect nested within this larger climatic framework. In theory, therefore, it ought to be those times of global ‘icehouse’ mode, when the eff ects of orbital variations would have been most pronounced, that should relate to times of increased isolation and, associated with this, spe- ciation and evolution of new taxa. 09-WillisandMcElwain-Chap09.indd 31409-WillisandMcElwain-Chap09.indd 314 11/28/13 1:19 PM11/28/13 1:19 PM 3159.3 THE MECHANISMS DRIVING EVOLUTIONARY CHANGE However, during these icehouse phases, the plant fossil record would still appear to sug- gest that the predominant trend is for a reduction in turnover and relative plateauing in total global species diversity, rather than an increase. During the Carbo-Permian glaciation (~300–280 Ma), for example, where there is clear geological evidence for extensive ice caps at the poles ( Frakes et al ., 1992 ) ( Figure 3.3 ), the plant fossil record indicates that the number of extinctions is high and only slightly lower than the number of originations ( Cascales- Miňana and Cleal, 2012 ). Th erefore, even during an extensive period of glaciation (~20 Ma) there appears to be no strong evidence for increased speciation due to cold-stage isolation, although there are clearly some speciation events occurring, possibly in refugially isolated populations ( Willis and Niklas, 2004 ).

However, at the broadest scale, isolation and redistribution during the mul- tiple glacial/interglacial cycles lead to a reduction in species numbers as more extinctions occur than originations. What is observed on Milankovitch timescales could therefore be no more than what occurs on much shorter (i.e. ecological) timescales. In a sense this is what is being suggested in the turnover pulse hypothesis of Bennett ( 1990 , 1997 ) because it is predicted that in a tiered system the second tier will be orbital forcing of the climate, leading to disruption of communities and loss of accumulated change, and only rarely will the third tier, that of speciation through geographically isolated populations created by the perpetual environmental changes of Milankovitch timescales, come into play ( Table 9.2 ). In addition, it is suggested on the broadest timescale (in this case 26 million years is suggested) that a fourth tier, that of mass extinctions, will be the ultimate driving mechanism through the sorting of species created in the third tier. But as discussed previously, this tier is ‘borrowed’ from the animal record, and since evidence from the plant fossil record suggests that there are no comparable mass extinctions, resulting in signifi cant declines in plant family diversity, another fourth tier must be sought ( Willis and Bennett, 1995 ). So what is the uppermost tier driving plant evolution? If the assumption is still to be made that the ultimate driving mechanism behind plant evolution is large-scale environ- mental change, then maybe a consideration of the scale of abiotic extrinsic stress ( sensu DiMichele et al ., 1987 ) is needed. Small-scale extrinsic abiotic stress occurs when popula- tions/species can migrate, adapt, become concentrated into refugial areas, and, following the removal of this adverse situation, species can usually re-emerge to fi ll their previously occupied niche. Th us, it could be argued that glacial/interglacial cycles cause small-scale extrinsic abiotic stress. Evidence from the fossil record suggests that plant populations/ species migrate, adapt, or become concentrated into refugial areas and when warm-stage conditions return, species re-emerge to fi ll their previously occupied niche (McElwain and Figure 9.13 Climatic megacycles during the Phanerozoic (~570 million years). Climatic megacycles during the past 570 Myr (Huggett 1997; Willis & McElwain 2002).

Small-scale extrinsic abiotic stress is therefore a two-way process, with populations responding to climatic change by shift s in distribution when the conditions are unfavourable and returning to the region when conditions once again improve. Th e same is not true, however, of large-scale extrinsic abiotic stress. Large-scale extrinsic abiotic stress is where populations cannot migrate fast enough, or the aerial extent of the stress exceeds their dispersal capacity ( DiMichele et al ., 1987 ; McElwain and Punyasena, 2007 ; Mander et al ., 2010 ). Th is type of stress tends to be unidi- rectional in that the change is invariably a threshold event from which there is no return. Examples of such environmental changes that may bring about such thresholds, at least for the plant kingdom, are changing continental positions resulting from tectonic activity, and associated environmental and climatic change. Superplumes and Large Igneous Provinces Plate boundary reorganizations involving collisions, rift ing, and changing patterns of intraplate stress have occurred throughout Earth history and each ‘pulse’ of activity will have infl uenced almost all aspects of the global environment ( Partridge et al ., 1995 ). Environmental changes associated with plate boundary reorganizations include the physical eff ects of plates moving together or apart, resulting for example in the opening or closing of seaways, large- scale tectonic uplift , isolation or recombination of continents, changing sea-levels, and climatic change ( Ruddiman, 1997 ). Climate change associated with plate boundary reor- ganizations results from alterations to the major patterns of ocean current and atmospheric circulation, due to changes in the position of continental plates and orogenic belts associated with tectonic uplift (thus infl uencing continental patterns of wind and rainfall), and from changing atmospheric concentrations driven primarily by intensifi ed volcanism. Geological evidence from continental fl ood-basalts, continental drift rates, sea-fl oor spreading, and subduction rates and mountain building events, indicates that global plate spreading and subduction may have been episodic, with relatively short periods of activity separated by long periods of inactivity. Th ese short periods of intense activity are called superplumes ( Larson, 1991a ). Superplume intervals were associated with increased rates of sea-fl oor spreading, enhanced volcanic activity, and mantle degassing. Th ese combined tectonic changes would have resulted in enhanced greenhouse gas emis- sions (in particular increased atmospheric CO 2 ; Larson, 1991a ) and possibly methane ( Jahren et al ., 2005 ) and eustatic sea-level rise ( Berner et al ., 1983 ; Arthur et al ., 1985 ; Sheridan, 1987 , 1997 ). Th e overall eff ect of these changes on global climate would have been to increase global temperatures and also humidity (increased humidity related to the greater areas of shallow sea), thus leading to increased evaporation and moisture-holding capacity of the atmosphere. Th e proposed mechanisms behind superplume events are described elsewhere (reviewed by Larson, 1991a ; Abbot and Isley, 2002 ; Condie, 2004 ). Of interest here is the timing and environmental impact of superplumes and an assess- ment of whether they contributed to patterns of speciation and extinction observed in the fossil record. Five major superplume intervals are recognized over the past 4 billion years of Earth history according to Condie ( 2004 ) : 2700 Ma (Neoarchean), 1900 Ma (Paleoproterozoic), 480 Ma (Lower Ordovician), 280 Ma (early Permian), and 100 Ma (mid Cretaceous) ( Figure 9.3 ). 09-WillisandMcElwain-Chap09.indd 31709-WillisandMcElwain-Chap09.indd 317 11/28/13 1:19 PM11/28/13 1:19 PM 318 9 EVOLUTIONARY THEORIES AND THE PLANT FOSSIL RECORD 2700 Ma (Neoarchean) Th is superplume interval predates the origin of land plants by well over 2 billion years; however, it does centre on a time in Earth history when there is growing evidence for the widespread occurrence of photosynthetic cyanobacterial mats in aquatic settings and predates the earliest evidence for land dwelling cyanobacterial colonies (at 3500 Ma; Schopf, 2006a ) by 100 Ma. 1900 Ma (Paleoproterozoic) Th e Paleoproterozoic superplume interval broadly coincides with an important step change in biological complexity from prokaryotic to eukaryotic life. Th e earliest fossil evidence for eukaryotes is now dated to 1870 Ma (see Chapter 2 ). 480 Ma (Lower Ordovician) Th is superplume period, centred around 480 Ma in the Lower Ordovician, immediately precedes the earliest unequivocal evidence for terrestrialization of the land by land plants ( see Chapter 3 ). 280 Ma (early Permian) Th is superplume interval is associated with plate coalescence, this time resulting in the creation of Pangea from the collision between Gondwana and Kazakhstan, and Siberia and Kazakhstan ( Rowley et al ., 1985 ; Briggs, 1995 ). In the plant fossil record from 280 Ma (end of the Carbo-Permian glaciation) there is evidence for a major radiation of gymnosperms, starting with the fi rst appearance of cycads and bennettites at approximately 280 Ma, ginkgos at 270 Ma, and the conifers from 260 Ma or earlier ( see Chapter 5 ). 100 Ma (middle Cretaceous; Aptian–Cenomanian) Th e mid Cretaceous superplume interval is perhaps the best known among the fi ve. Th is major tectonic episode is related to the time of break-up of Pangea and rapid sea-fl oor spreading episodes in the Atlantic and Pacifi c. Th ese resulted in formation of the South Atlan- tic Ocean margins, the Indian Ocean margins (east of Madagascar and between Australia and Antarctica), and the northern Atlantic Ocean margins between Europe, Canada, and Green- land. Th e fi rst unequivocal fossil evidence for the origin and initiation of a massive radiation of angiosperm lineages occurred between approximately 120 and 80 Ma ( see Chapter 6 ). Given that superplume intervals last on the order of 10 to 100 million years, it appears that each superplume interval is broadly associated with step changes in biological or ecological complexity on the evolutionary line leading to and including land plants. Th e fi rst coincides with the transition from aquatic to terrestrial habitats among photosynthetic cyanobacteria ( Chapter 2 ), the second with the origin of eukaryotic life, the third with the earliest terrestri- alization of the planet by the ancestors of modern land plants ( Chapter 3 ), the fourth with a major radiation of seed plant groups ( Chapter 5 ), and the fi nal mid-Cretaceous superplume with the origin of a high proportion of extant angiosperm lineages ( Chapter 6 ). Th erefore, although there is no apparent simple correlation between superplume episodes and rates of 09-WillisandMcElwain-Chap09.indd 31809-WillisandMcElwain-Chap09.indd 318 11/28/13 1:19 PM11/28/13 1:19 PM 3199.3 THE MECHANISMS DRIVING EVOLUTIONARY CHANGE plant speciation, extinction, or turnover ( Figure 9.3 ), they do seem to be in some way linked to important evolutionary ‘fi rsts’. Additional tectonic events worth assessing for their likely impact on the tempo of plant evolution are Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs), some of which (although not all) are associated with superplume intervals ( Coffi n and Eldholm, 1994 ; King and Anderson, 1995 ; Wignall, 2001 ). LIPs, like superplume intervals, are pulsed events, and involve the produc- tion of vast quantities of basalt lava that fl ood the land and ocean fl oor, termed fl ood basalt provinces and oceanic plateau events, respectively ( Wignall, 2001 ; Courtillot and Renne, 2003 ; Ernst et al ., 2005 ; Ganino and Arndt, 2009 ). Probably one of the most important distinctions between LIPs and superplumes is their timing/rates of impact. Most of the LIP events were geologically rapid, occurring over 1 to 2 million years ( Wignall, 2001 ). Th ey appear to have occurred throughout Earth’s history around every ~50 million years. LIPs have been temporally correlated with faunal mass extinction events ( Courtillot and Renne, Figure 9.14 Percentage of extinction recorded for marine invertebrate fossil genera (from Rohde and Muller, 2005 ) versus volume of basalt produced due to the formation of Large Igneous Provinces (from Courtillot and Renne, 2003 ). The grey shaded area of the graph highlights times of normal background levels of faunal extinction. The non-shaded portion of the graph indicates faunal mass extinction events. Note that volume of basalt produced during LIP formation is not as good a predictor of extinction magnitude as is the chemistry of the local rock into which basalt intrudes. All LIPs associated with faunal mass extinction events involved basalt intrusion into source rocks that released large quantities of greenhouse (CO 2 and CH 4 ) and toxic gases (H 2 S, SO 2 ).

Th e severity of the environmental and biological impact of LIPs is thought to be associated with the chemical composition of the local rock into which basalts are intruded ( Figure 9.15 ) rather than the volume of basalt they produced ( Ganino and Arndt, 2009 ) ( Table 9.3 ). Th e environmental changes associated with LIPs include both long- and short-term impacts such as greenhouse gas induced climate warming, ozone depletion due to volcanic release of halocarbons, acid rain, and SO 2 -induced global cooling ( Figure 9.15 ) ( Wignall, 2001 ). As marked increases in faunal extinction have been linked with environmental change triggered by LIP events, could LIP events also be invoked as a driver of plant turnover and macroevolution? A brief comparison of the timing of LIPs and plant speciation and extinction patterns through Earth history indicates some intriguing patterns ( Table 9.4 ). LIPs appear to coincide with times of either higher than normal speciation and/or extinction for approximately 45 per cent of the time over the past 500 million years. For example, some LIPs appear to be associated with times of prolifi c speciation such as across the K-Pg boundary, which coincides with the Deccan Flood Basalt province ( Table 9.4 ). However, other LIP intervals such as the Karoo-Ferrar in the early Jurassic, the Parana-Etendeka Traps, and the Ontong Java Plateau are not associated with any obvious increase in either plant speciation or extinction rate but do coincide with intervals of large-scale turnover and spikes in the fossil record of lycopsids and/or fern assemblages ( Table 9.4 ). Ganino and Arndt ( 2009 ) highlighted that the chemical composition of source rock into which the LIPs intrude will determine the severity of environmental change associated with the LIP, with sulphur-laden Table 9.3 Environmental impacts of Large Igneous Provinces associated with the intrusion of basalt into different local rock strata.

Further research is now required to establish whether there are any common environmental changes associated with the subset of LIPs that coincide with major events in plant evolution identifi ed in Table 9.4 . Amount of available land area Major tectonic events such as superplume intervals and the intrusion of Large Igneous Prov- inces appear to be temporally correlated with some patterns in plant evolution but clearly not all ( Figure 9.3 ; Table 9.4 ). Could other pulsed tectonic episodes, such as the break-up or formation of supercontinents, have infl uenced plant speciation rate on time scales of tens to hundreds of millions of years? Specifi cally, could the formation of supercontinents infl uence plant speciation by increasing the amount of available land area?

Attempts to correlate land area to diversity in the plant fossil record for the 12 geological stages from the Devonian to middle Miocene of the northern hemisphere (~410–10 Ma) revealed a strong positive correlation between land area and plant diversity ( Tiff ney and Niklas, 1990 ). It is, however, diffi cult to determine whether this is associated with a pronounced correlation between land area and total number of uplands, or purely land area alone. Th us, increased diversity may result from the increased area available or as a result of topographical diversity created by a greater number of habitats over a smaller latitudinal area, resulting in increased isolation from biotic exchange through topographical barriers. In addition, both total land area and upland areas strongly correlate with geological age (i.e. there are increasingly greater areas of land and also mountains as the Earth gets younger). It is concluded, therefore, that this correlation is probably indicative of a long-term trend of increased area of continental plate correlating with increased species numbers through time, rather than punctuated events of evolution corresponding to periods of increased land area resulting from continental plate movements ( Tiff ney and Niklas, 1990 ). Th is is supported by a recent study by Fine and Ree ( 2006 ) who have suggested that geographical area and age are important determinants of dif- ferences observed in modern day biome-level plant diversity. Th ey argue that tree diversity in the modern day tropics is much higher than that of the boreal biome because the tropical everwet biome is signifi cantly older ( Chapter 7 ) and has occupied a greater geographical area over the past 65 million years than the boreal forest ( Fine and Ree, 2006 ). Number of separate land masses Th ere is much evidence from the animal record (both marine and terrestrial) to suggest that the greater the number of land masses, the greater the diversity of organisms ( Kurtén, 1967 , 1969 ; Valentine and Moores, 1970 ). Th us, fragmentation of supercontinents leads to isolated populations and, over time, this leads to the evolution of new species (allopatric speciation). Again, what is good in evolutionary terms for the terrestrial record might be the total op- posite for the ocean record, and vice versa. As two continents approach each other and even- tually become joined, for example, the terrestrial fauna and fl ora may exhibit convergence because of the creation of a corridor, whereas the marine organisms may exhibit divergence, forming new species because of separation and isolation ( Hallam, 1983 ). Th ere are numerous examples where a causal mechanism has been invoked between number of species and continental fragmentation. For example, it has been suggested that without break-up of the global landmass into continents and islands, the Earth would have only half of its present biodiversity ( Holmes, 1998 ). However, attempts to correlate the dis- persion of land masses through geological time with land plant diversity suggest that there is no signifi cant correlation ( Tiff ney and Niklas, 1990 ). Th us, the number of land plants shows no correlation with increasing numbers of separate land masses. Th is evidence therefore ap- pears to be at odds with observations of the present global diversity of plants and animals. But the scale of evolutionary change examined must also be remembered, since the changes in land plant diversity being compared by Tiff ney and Niklas ( 1990 ) are the broadest-scale changes—those in eff ect attributable to an uppermost tier in an evolutionary model ( sensu 09-WillisandMcElwain-Chap09.indd 32309-WillisandMcElwain-Chap09.indd 323 11/28/13 1:19 PM11/28/13 1:19 PM 324 9 EVOLUTIONARY THEORIES AND THE PLANT FOSSIL RECORD Gould, 1995 ). Lower-order evolutionary change has obviously occurred throughout geo- logical time and is still occurring presently, whereby isolation may lead to speciation (allopa- try). At the broadest evolutionary scale (uppermost tier), however, separation of land masses at particular points in geological time does not appear to account for the major changes seen in the plant evolutionary record. Th is is also consistent with many recent molecular clock studies (reviewed in Pennington et al ., 2009 ), which indicate that many lineages have under- gone very recent speciation events on timescales that cannot be explained by tectonic-driven isolation. Instead, long-distance dispersal events across oceans and subsequent ecological processes within communities and biomes appear to be more important in driving recent speciation events in many angiosperm clades ( Pennington et al ., 2009 ). Latitudinal distribution of land masses A comparison of the diversity of species with the latitudinal distribution of land masses must also be considered. It may not be the association between tectonic activity and the size or number of land masses that has infl uenced large-scale patterns in plant evolution through time, but rather the eff ect that plate spreading has had on their latitudinal position. Present- day observations on global plant diversity, for example, indicate that there is a negative re- lationship between latitude and species diversity ( Stevens, 1992 ), with decreasing diversity towards the poles and increasing diversity towards the equator. Whether or not this relates to local extinction associated with more inclement and/or unstable climatic conditions as certain land masses moved towards the poles, or rather greater rates of origination or specia- tion in areas of more favourable climate or climatic stability, is highly debatable. Evidence from the geological record suggests some justifi cation for the latter point, both in terms of regions of origination and also correlation between land plant diversity and latitudi- nal distribution of the land masses. Evidence from the plant fossil record suggests that, with one or two exceptions, the main angiosperm groups originated in the equatorial regions, either in South America–Africa or the general South-East Asia area ( see Chapter 6 ), and then radi- ated out into higher latitudes ( Lidgard and Crane, 1988 ; Barrett and Willis, 2001 ). In addition, a comparison of the diversity of pteridophyte species with the latitudinal distribution of land over geological time apparently indicates a positive correlation with area of land in the equato- rial region ( Tiff ney and Niklas, 1990 ). Th us, as area of land at or near the equator increased, so too did the number of pteridophyte taxa. Th ere is also a positive correlation between seed plant diversity and poleward displacement of continental area ( Tiff ney and Niklas, 1990 ). But this still does not provide an explanation as to why major plant groups evolved at particular times in the geological record. Land masses with relatively stable climatic regimes were located in the equatorial regions long before the origination of the main pteridophyte or angiosperm groups. Furthermore, although these regions were probably important centres of origination with regard to both plants ( Crane and Lidgard, 1989 ; Burnham and Johnson, 2004 ; Fine and Ree, 2006 ; Jaramillo et al ., 2006 ) and animals ( Jablonski, 1993 ), the times of major innovation in the plant fossil record do not consistently coincide with times of plate move- ments towards the equator. Furthermore, during much of the Permian and Jurassic, it appears from plant biogeographical analysis that regions of high plant diversity were centred on the temperate latitudes rather than the tropical latitudes, which were predominantly low diversity summerwet and desert biomes ( Chapter 5 , Figure 5.19 ). Without a more detailed data set, including, for example, clearer evidence for regions of origination for lycopsids, sphenopsids, 09-WillisandMcElwain-Chap09.indd 32409-WillisandMcElwain-Chap09.indd 324 11/28/13 1:19 PM11/28/13 1:19 PM 3259.3 THE MECHANISMS DRIVING EVOLUTIONARY CHANGE ginkgoales, and cycadales, to name but a few, along with interpretation of climatic conditions associated with the latitudes at these points in time, such correlations will remain spurious. A similar conclusion was reached by Tiff ney and Niklas ( 1990 ) , who suggested that ‘although the latitudinal distribution of land may have profoundly aff ected diversity in times of steep global temperature gradient, such gradients are so scattered in the history of plant evolution that they may have had little eff ect on the overall trend of land plant diversity’. Changes in atmospheric composition Periods of tectonic activity, superplumes, and LIPs also resulted in large scale and global dis- turbance of the Earth’s biogeochemical cycles, in particular the cycling of elements such as carbon and sulphur. Th is in turn would have impacted the concentration of carbon dioxide, oxygen, and sulphur in the atmosphere. In the following sections we explore the potential direct and indirect role of changing atmospheric composition on plant macroevolution. CO 2 and O 2 Th e two atmospheric gases of greatest direct relevance to the biology of plants are oxygen and carbon dioxide. Atmospheric oxygen is vital for aerobic respiration in plants, which involves aerobic metabolism of sugars (glucose) to generate ATP. In plants, as in all other eukaryotic organisms, oxygen is used as the fi nal electron acceptor in this process. Respiration fuels growth and development, repair, and reproduction in all land plants. Carbon dioxide, on the other hand, is the primary substrate for glucose production via the process of photosynthesis. Both gases compete for binding sites on the enzyme RUBISCO; when CO 2 binds, carboxylation reactions take place and photosynthesis proceeds. When O 2 binds, oxygenation reactions occur in a process known as photorespiration, which results in the release of CO 2 . Photorespiration decreases the effi ciency of photosynthesis and is considered a ‘wasteful’ process by some; however, it is considered by others to be a vital process for whole plant wellbeing as it protects the plant from high light and provides a sink for damaging reactive oxygen species. Th e composition of both gases have fl uctuated widely throughout Earth history ( Berner and Kothavala, 2001 ; Berner, 2006 ; Bergman et al ., 2004 ), driven in the long term by fac- tors infl uencing the biogeochemical cycling of carbon and sulphur, and in the short term by pulsed tectonic episodes such as superplumes and Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs). Th e fi rst 3 billion years of Earth history are characterized by trace levels of oxygen, highly el- evated levels of greenhouse gases such as CO 2 and CH 4 , and likely high levels of hydrogen sulphide and sulphur dioxide. Following the great oxygenation event around 2450 Ma ( Chapter 2 ), oxygen levels began to rise slowly but steadily to near modern day ambient levels in the Devonian, and to all-time highs of >26 per cent in the Carboniferous. Al- though there is considerable uncertainty regarding the detailed progression of O 2 change since the Carboniferous (~359 to 298 Ma), it is likely that much of Triassic and Jurassic (252 to 145 Ma) had lower O 2 levels than the Cretaceous period that followed ( Bergman et al ., 2004 ). In near mirror contrast with O 2 , atmospheric CO 2 levels were super-elevated in the fi rst 3 billion years and declined from more than ten times higher than present in the Silurian and Devonian to near modern ambient levels in the Carboniferous. Much of the Triassic and Jurassic is characterized by levels approximately four to fi ve times higher 09-WillisandMcElwain-Chap09.indd 32509-WillisandMcElwain-Chap09.indd 325 11/28/13 1:19 PM11/28/13 1:19 PM 326 9 EVOLUTIONARY THEORIES AND THE PLANT FOSSIL RECORD than modern levels, dropping to modern levels from about the mid Cretaceous onwards. Short-term CO 2 increases (due to LIPs etc.) and declines (due to high burial rates of or- ganic C) are superimposed on these long-term trends. Figure 9.16 summarizes trends for both gases by plotting the ratio of oxygen to carbon dioxide over the past 450 million years. It is clear that considerable uncertainty remains regarding the long-term trends in both atmospheric and plant evolution; however, based on current understanding, it appears that the times of highest speciation rate in Earth history broadly coincide with times of highest O 2 :CO 2 ratio ( Figure 9.16 ). Th e temporal correlation could of course be purely coincidental.

Th e presence of this biome type for millions of years would have provided plants with ample temperatures and precipitation with little seasonality, thus ensuring the potential for high productivity and acting as a ‘cradle’ for high speciation rate. Th ere is, however, a possibility that high O 2 :CO 2 ratio in some way directly drives increased plant speciation rate. Hypo- thetical mechanisms, which require further research, include the following: (1) Atmospheric conditions with a high O 2 :CO 2 ratio increase the prevalence and oc- currence of wildfi re events. According to Bond and Keeley ( 2005 ) , wildfi re behaves like a ‘global herbivore’ and is a considerable evolutionary force. Many of the earliest known an- giosperm fossils from the early Cretaceous are preserved as charcoal ( Chapter 6 ). Could fre- quent wildfi re events have selected for short life cycles such as annuals and a range of other morphological and developmental novelties that increased speciation rate? (2) Based on current understanding of photosynthesis, it is expected that high O 2 :CO 2 ratios would drastically reduce the effi ciency of C3 photosynthesis and select for novel photosynthetic biochemistry such as C4 and CAM photosynthesis ( Chapter 7 ). Multiple independent origins of new species with C4 photosynthesis in the Palaeogene ( Christin et al ., 2008 ; Osborne and Beerling, 2006 ) support this hypothesis, yet to date only the role of CO 2 decline as a driving force of C4 evolution has been considered, rather than long-term changes in O 2 . It has also been proposed that a novel CAM-like biochemistry originated under the high O 2 :CO 2 atmospheres in the Carboniferous ( Green, 2010 ) ( Figure 9.18 ). Could the origin of these novel biochemistries in the Carboniferous and Tertiary have en- hanced the speciation rate of the descendant clades? (3) High O 2 :CO 2 atmospheres may be more mutagenic. Th is conjecture is based on the observation that plant cells produce more reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs), which can damage DNA and RNA, under stressed conditions such as drought or pathogen attack. Th is occurs when CO 2 is not available in suffi cient supply to drive photosynthesis and electrons from reduction of the photosynthetic machinery are instead diverted towards O 2 , resulting in the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ROIs ( Mittler, 2002 ). An atmosphere rich in oxygen but low in CO 2 would have a similar consequence for plant physiology. It is possible, therefore, that high oxygen atmospheres in the past caused more oxidative damage, via the action of ROI, resulting in increased rates of mutation and subsequent speciation. (4) A fi nal explanation is that any large-scale change in atmospheric composition of either oxygen or carbon dioxide would dramatically alter the competitive landscape of plants, thus driving speciation and extinction ( Feild et al ., 2011 ; Haworth et al ., 2011 ; McElwain et al ., 2009 , 2011 ) ( Figure 9.19 ). Both gases are, therefore, of huge biological importance and, unlike climate changes in temperature and/or precipitation, are felt evenly across the whole globe, removing the opportunity to avoid change through migration. An example of this can be taken from the Cretaceous fossil plant record, where declining CO 2 likely provided a competitive advantage to the angiosperms, which rapidly evolved traits to improve carbon gain and increase transpiration ( McElwain et al ., 2005 ; Feild et al ., 2011 ) ( Chapter 6 ), enabling them to out- compete gymnosperms and spore-bearing groups (pteridophytes) ( Figure 9.19 ). 09-WillisandMcElwain-Chap09.indd 32809-WillisandMcElwain-Chap09.indd 328 11/28/13 1:19 PM11/28/13 1:19 PM 3299.3 THE MECHANISMS DRIVING EVOLUTIONARY CHANGE Figure 9.18 Patterns of change in atmospheric CO 2 (a), O 2 (b), and species diversity of woody lycopsids (lycophytes) (c), redrawn from Green ( 2010 ) .

In this case, it would have been the reaction of sulphur on atmospheric chemistry and the resulting impact of SO 2 on the ozone layer that could have had a signifi cant global impact through increased ultraviolet radiation ( Wignall, 2001 ; Ganino and Arndt, 2009 ). Modelling suggests, for example, that with the Siberian trap LIP (~250 Ma), the ozone layer would have been thinned by up to 80 per cent in mid to high latitudes ( Beerling et al ., 2007 ). Th e impact of large surges in incoming UV-B radiation (wavelength = 280–315 nm) resulting from this thinned ozone layer could have been profound ( Rozema et al ., 2002 ; McKenzie et al ., 2007 ; Willis et al., 2009 ). Increased exposure to ultraviolet radiation presently is known to have a whole host of specifi c eff ects on human health, crops, terrestrial ecosystems, and biogeochemical cycles (e.g. Rozema et al ., 1997 ; Rozema et al ., 2002 ; Caldwell et al ., 2007 ; Solheim et al ., 2006 ; Zepp et al ., 2007 ; Figure 9.19 (a), (b), (c) The relationships between the percentage abundance of fossil pollen in fossil ﬂ oras of angiosperms, gymnosperms, and pteridophytes, respectively, with atmospheric CO 2 change during the Cretaceous (~last 140 million years).

Results indicate that the overall trend of declining CO 2 concentration through the Cretaceous differentially inﬂ uenced each grade, favouring angiosperms over gymnosperms over pteridophytes, respectively.

Th e impact of increased exposure of plants to UV-B is well studied, with evidence to indicate DNA damage, mutagenesis, re- duction in above-ground biomass and height, and a decrease in overall fi tness (e.g. Lake et al ., 2009 ; Newsham and Robinson, 2009 ). Th e impact of past changes in incoming UV-B fl ux on terrestrial ecosystems could therefore have had a signifi cant impact on all aspects of ecosystem functioning and fi tness in plants from genes to biomes, including possibly altering the mode and rate of evolution ( Cockell, 1999 ; Visscher et al ., 2004 ; Beerling et al ., 2007 ; Willis et al ., 2009 ). An area of research that warrants further investigation is whether intervals of large UV-B fl ux correlate with intervals of evolutionary innovation, speciation, and/or extinction. Circumstantial evidence appears to suggest that this is indeed the case for some intervals of change ( Table 9.4 ) but similar to the other atmospheric variables dis- cussed previously, this is a research area that requires a lot more investigation before a clear causal link can be established. Conclusions In conclusion, evidence from the plant fossil record indicates a broadening spectrum of diversity and morphological and developmental complexity through time. Th e plant fossil record suggests that, on the broadest scale, major evolutionary change and innovation was concentrated into relatively short intervals in geological time, such as the late Devonian and early Carboniferous, followed by long intervals of relatively little evolutionary innovation. Most of the major reproductive grades declined in total species diversity following the evo- lution of a new grade, although this has yet to happen with the angiosperms. Th e macroevolutionary timescale of plants does not follow that of animals. Th ere is no evidence for plant mass extinction of an equivalent magnitude to that seen in the fossil faunal records during at least four of the ‘big fi ve’ extinction events ( Chapter 8 ). Plant spe- cies turnover was indeed high and the ecological landscape shift ed signifi cantly follow- ing faunal mass extinction events; however, the great fl oral evolutionary transitions from spore bearing groups (pteridophytes) to gymnosperms and from gymnosperms to angio- sperms do not coincide with the ‘big fi ve’ faunal mass extinction boundaries ( Chapter 1 , Chapter 8 ). Plants appear to be inherently more resilient than animals to environmental change ( Chapter 8 ), yet the plant fossil record strongly indicates that major environmental transitions played defi ning roles in triggering plant evolution. Changes in atmospheric composition have been invoked for the origin of leaves ( Chapter 4 ), for multiple inde- pendent origins of CAM and C4 photosynthesis ( Chapter 7 ), for escalation in angiosperm vein density ( Chapter 6 ), and perhaps also for triggering whole genome duplication events ( Chapters 8 and 9 ). Biological interactions including adaptation, competition, and co- evolution must have played a role in terrestrial diversifi cation ( Chapter 6 ) and, in par- ticular, they are thought to have been responsible for the decline in species diversity of incumbent groups or clades of plants as new ones evolved. However, these interactions do not appear to be responsible for the timing of major episodes of speciation observed in the plant fossil record. If the ultimate causes of evolutionary change in the plant fossil record are organized into a hierarchical scheme of causality, then an alternative uppermost tier to mass extinctions 09-WillisandMcElwain-Chap09.indd 33109-WillisandMcElwain-Chap09.indd 331 11/28/13 1:19 PM11/28/13 1:19 PM 332 9 EVOLUTIONARY THEORIES AND THE PLANT FOSSIL RECORD (proposed for the animal record; Gould, 1995 ) must be sought. We have identifi ed many potential drivers, including plate movements, changes in land mass area, climate, and al- terations to atmospheric concentrations and chemistry (e.g. UV-B radiation, high O 2 :CO 2 ratio), yet no single factor can currently account for the entirety of the observed macro- evolutionary pattern. It is likely that the integration of modern phylogenetic methods with improved understanding of atmospheric and climatic evolution from fossil plant proxies, and greater insights into the time of origin of diff erent plant lineages from new fossil plant discoveries, will highlight which among the many hypothesized macroevolutionary driv- ers that we have discussed in this chapter can account for the patterns of plant extinction and speciation observed. An ‘uppermost tier’ explaining plant macroevolution therefore remains elusive. 09-WillisandMcElwain-Chap09.indd 33209-WillisandMcElwain-Chap09.indd 332 11/28/13 1:19 PM11/28/13 1:19 PM Bibliography APG [= Angiosperm Phylogeny Group] (1998) An ordinal classifi cation for the families of fl owering plants.
