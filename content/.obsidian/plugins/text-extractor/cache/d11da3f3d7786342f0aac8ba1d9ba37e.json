Exopodite can be paddle- like Arenaeus cribrarius DOI: 10.48550/arXiv.2202.01037 ARTHROPOD LIMB MOVEMENTS Schilling et al., 2013 DOI 10.1007/s00422-013-0563-5 ✓ Elevation (levator) ✓ Protraction (protractor) ✓ Depression (depressor) ✓ Retraction (retractor- hidden) Anterior posterior LOW GEARED WALKING! ✓ Myriapoda- metachronal leg movement at slow speed (millipedes) ✓ Short legs ✓ At faster speeds (centipedes) fewer legs in contact with ground Photo: Thomas Shahan LIMB TRAJECTORIES AVOID TRIPPINGMORE METACHRONAL WAVES ✓ Metachronal ✓ L1, R2, L3: R1, L2, R3 ✓ Contralateral out of phase ✓ >3 legs have contact at any one time FLIGHT ✓ Hexapods are the only true flying insects ✓ Only adults (imagos) fly ✓ Very diverse flight modes (c.f. vertebrates ✓ Exopterygote versus Endopterygote development David Wilcockson HOW TO FLY?GRAVITY THRUSTDRAGLIFT VARIATIONS IN FORM ✓Evolved over 300 Mya- probably from respiratory gills or thermoregulatory structures ✓Meso- & metathorax ✓FW, HW similar e.g. Odonata ✓Feathery e.g. Thysanoptera ✓Small HW e.g. Hymenoptera Coupling ✓Diptera Halteres http://anic.ento.csiro.au/thrips/identifying_thrips/Phlaeothripidae.htm INSECT WINGS ✓Thin cuticular membranes criss-crossed with veins containing haemolymph ✓Beetles -the forewings are protective- the elytra ✓Dipterans, the hindwings are reduced to form balance organs- halteres (gyroscopes) DIRECT FLIGHT MUSCLES ✓ Primitive condition ✓ Muscles attach directly to wing bases ✓ E.g. Odonata- Wings independent Pronation/supination ✓ Synchronous- 1:1 nerve impulses to wingbeat INDIRECT FLIGHT MUSCLES ✓ Muscles attach to thoracic walls ✓ Wing is extension of tergal plate ✓ Articulates with pleural plate ✓ Thoracic box deforms when these contract ✓ Elastic properties of cuticle- RESILIN protein INDIRECT FLIGHT MUSCLES RESILIN- WONDERFUL STUFF! The wing hinge contains resilin- an almost perfect elastic! ASYNCHRONOUS VERSUS SYNCHRONOUS ✓ Synchronous (e.g. Odonata) has 1:1 ratio of impulses to contraction ✓ Asynchronous has multiple contractions per impulse ✓ Stretch activation of one muscle stimulates its antagonistic muscle ✓ Many beats per second ✓ High activity muscles rich in Ca2+ ‘VORTICES- ‘CLAP AND FLING’ ✓Wings ‘clap’ at top of upstroke ✓Leading edges separate, air is sucked in ✓Vortex; accelerated airflow ✓Vortex shedding Miller & Peskin (2009) JEB 212: 3076-3090- see also Box 10.8 The Invertebrates: A Synthesis JUMPING ✓Escape response! ✓Impressive distances ✓Special adaptations ✓Locust as an example Richard Bartz (cc-BY) LOCUST HINDLEGS 0 20 40 60 80 100 Myo.

ENERGY STORAGE RESILIN ✓Almost perfect elastic recovery ✓Excellent spring – energy loss 5% @ 200Hz ✓Long fatigue lifetime ✓Wing hinges, flight muscle tendons, tymbals, flea jump THE SEMI-LUNAR (SL) PROCESS Femoro-tibial joint Semi-lunar process Resilin http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~wjh/jumping/index.htmlImage: Simmons et al (2010)THE JUMP SEQUENCE 1.
