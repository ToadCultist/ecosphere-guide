Plasma membranes are semi permeable (selectively permeable)Molecules can move through plasma membranes in two main ways: Passive transport where no energy is expended or active transport that requires the cell to use energy in the form of ATP Focus on passive transport Diffusion (and osmosis) are examples of passive transport If a molecule is lipid-soluble, uncharged and /or very small, it can diffuse passively through the cell membrane by simple diffusion. Movement of ions, solutes, water etc from region of high concn to a lower one Diffusion can be ‘Simple’ or ‘Facilitated’ Simple diffusion occurs through the lipid bilayer. Carrier or channel proteins in the plasma membrane also help certain molecules to pass across by facilitated diffusion. Simple and facilitated diffusion require a concentration gradient but no energy input. Concept of a solution For this practical, it is important to understand the difference between solvents and solutes Eg. A sugar solution is formed when sucrose (the solute) is dissolved in water (the solvent) Chemical states Although according to chemical theory, solutes and solvents can each be in any state (solid, liquid or gas). Here we will focus on simple solutions of solids in liquids or liquids in liquids. Solute v solvent It is usually obvious what is the solvent and the solute in any particular solution. However when say water and ethanol are mixed, either can be the solute/solvent depending on the concentration of each. For the various solutions you will use in the practical, water is always the solvent (ie. they are all aqueous solutions). A solution is a homogenous mixture. You cannot mechanically separate (eg by simple filtration) one substance from another within the solution. If you dissolve sugar in water but some of the sugar is still laying on the bottom of the container (or even floating moved by movement of water) then this not part of the solution. Osmosis is a special case of diffusion. It is the diffusion of water through a semi-permeable membrane down a concentration gradient (of water molecules). The concentration of water molecules in a solution inversely reflects the solute concentration. So.. If two solutions are separated by a membrane that is more permeable to the solvent than the solute (a semi-permeable membrane), the solvent (commonly water) moves through the SPM from lower solute concn to a higher one [ie. higher water concentration to a lower one]. If red blood cells are placed into water (or a hypotonic aqueous solution) water will move into the cell by osmosis and cause the cell to burst (haemolyse) Understand the terms: Hypertonic, Isotonic and Hypotonic The ‘translucency’ of the blood in tube A indicates the erythrocytes are haemolysed (burst). The ‘opacity’ of the blood in tube B indicates the erythrocytes are intact. The erythrocyte permeability practical uses the ‘translucency’ / ‘opacity’ of blood to indicate whether the erythrocytes are haemolysed (burst) or not. If we put sheep's blood into a solution which is less concentrated (hypotonic / has a higher water potential) compared to the cell contents, and where the plasma membrane is impermeant to the solute, water will enter the erythrocyte cells by osmosis and the cells will burst (haemolyse). Osmosis depends on the total concn of all solutes on each side of the membrane. Part 1 and part 2 of the practical explores simple osmosis Simple osmosisComplex Osmosis (including a dimension of diffusion) If the plasma membrane is fully or partially permeable to the solute as well as the solvent in the external solution then the solute may pass through the membrane down a concentration gradient by diffusion. This generates a more complex situation where it will alter the overall internal / external osmotic potential and therefore movement of water. Diffusion depends on the concentration gradient of only that ion / solute. Part 3 of the practical investigates the rate of membrane permeation (and subsequent osmosis) of different solutes.","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":""}
