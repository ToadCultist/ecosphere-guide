Laporte) Birgus latro (https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Birgus_latro.jpg) PORIFERA ✓ Ammonia diffuses across entire choanoderm ✓ Choanoderm has high surface area ✓ Also, whole body convulsions! CNIDARIA ✓ Ammonia diffuses across body wall or through coelenteron David Wilcockson ULTRAFILTRATION- NEPHRIDIA Protonephridia ✓ Most basic excretory units ✓ Blind ending duct ✓ Filtration at ciliated flame cells ✓ Water passed through semi- permeable membrane. ✓ Small solutes pass through ✓ Dilute urine Reeflifesurvey.comULTRAFILTRATION- NEPHRIDIA Metanephridia ✓Ducts open internally (=nephrostome) ✓Ciliated collecting tubules to draw in fluid from coelom and create pressure (also blood pressure helps) ✓Ions and important molecules reabsorbed (ATP)- dilute urine - Author: K.D.

Malpighian tubules ✓Blind-ending tubes ✓Tubules lie free in the haemocoel. ✓Muscular ✓One cell thick ✓‘Principal cells’ (active transport) and stellate cells (passive water flow) ✓In some insects the distal ends are in close association with hindgut/rectum (later) HOW DO THE MALPIGHIAN TUBULES WORK? ✓Malpighian tubules produce PRIMARY URINE that carry with it water-soluble waste products and toxins ✓Low pressure- bathed in coelomic fluid but not pressurised by blood. RHODNIUS PROLIXUS ✓ Haematophagus insect (Triatominae) ✓ Blood meal can be as much as x10 body weight! ✓ Must off-load the fluid and salt components of this meal so as not to compromise osmotic or ionic balance RHODNIUS PROLIXUS ✓Erythrocytes are K+ rich & plasma Na+ rich. ✓Blood meal is, hyposmotic to haemolymph ✓ could unbalance the insect’s own system (~300mOsm/kgH2O compared to 370mOsmo/KgH2O). ✓MTs transport fluid at very high rates- (great for analysis and experimentation!) ✓Two-part process ✓rapid transport of NaCl solution ✓then rapid excretion of dilute urine at MTs.HOW IT ALL WORKS! Water impermeable proximal (lower) tubule. MTs in two parts- the upper (distal) rapidly transports K+ rich fluid from hemolymph to MT whilst the lower (proximal) actively resorbs KCl but not water from the MT. TENEBRIO MOLITOR CRYPTONEPHRIDIAL COMPLEX Naseem et al., (2023) PNAS. Covered in Current Biology (Arendt) A VERY SPECIAL RECTUM ✓Perirectal membrane fluid has extremely high osmotic potential ✓Due to active transport of solutes (e.g. KCl) ✓Water retained by osmosis- and very dry faecal pellets A SLIGHTLY BETTER DEPICTION Leptophragmata are enriched with NHA1- a cation anti-porter that exchanged H+ for K+ in the perinephric membrane Naseem et al., (2023) PNAS. Covered in Current Biology (Arendt) HOW DO WE KNOW THIS STUFF? • ‘Ramsay assay’ (Malpighian tubule assay) Ramsay, J.A., 1954. Active transport of water by the Malpighian tubules of the stick insect, Dixippus morosus (Orthoptera, Phasmidae). J. Exp. Biol. 31, 104–113. WHAT DID RAMSEY CONTRIBUTE? • …”the impact of the paper has been, not in its attempt to find out how water movement is achieved, but in the technique Ramsay developed to allow him to isolate the Malpighian tubules from the stick insect, keep them alive for some hours, and observe them secreting fluid….” • Maddrell review paper J. Exp Biol 207 SCALING UP AND INTEGRATING It is now common to make ‘arrays’ of Ramsay MT assays in dishes and record fluid production and potential differences under different experimental condition. RHODNIUS PROLIXUS ✓Half of ingested water in blood meal is excreted within one hour! ✓Abdominal stretching in Rhodnius triggers release of diuretic hormones (DHs) – these increase rate of primary urine production ✓Abdominal nerves release 5HT. Acts synergistically with DHs. DH31 acts on principle cells of MTs MT ACTIVE MOLECULES","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
