In 1859 Darwin was studying a Christmas orchid and noticed that to access the nectar in the orchid an insect would need to reach 29cm. He hypothesized that there must be an insect with a proboscis of that size. 11 years later Alfred Russell Wallace found a moth called the Morgan’s Sphinx with a 20 cm proboscis. Cheetahs and gazelles are a classic animal-animal model for coevolution. Cheetahs are considered the fastest land vertebrate (115 km/h). The second fastest land vertebrate is the gazelle (80 km/h). The gazelles need to be fastest enough to escape and reproduce – which selects for the fastest gazelles. This in turn selects for the fastest cheetahs. But if cheetahs eat all the gazelles they won’t have any food. Complex Co-evolution: The tetrodotoxin (TTX) story Rough-skinned newts in US produce potent toxin TTX Producing TTX requires energy, which leads to fewer offspring Garter snake eating a newt. Garter snakes have developed resistance to TTX. But in snakes have resistance means they have a slower crawling/slithering speed Complex Co-evolution: Parasites and Pathogens The Red Queen hypothesis Natural selection continually operates on each species to keep up with improvements made by each species. Modelling coevolution – Red queen card game Fitness: the ability to survive and reproduce Phenotype: physical description or trait of an organism Genotype: genetic description of an organism’s trait or phenotype In the RQH – parasites infect and ‘kill’ hosts that have a matching genotype.
