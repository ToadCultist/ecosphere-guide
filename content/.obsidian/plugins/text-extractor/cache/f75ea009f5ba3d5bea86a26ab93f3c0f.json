Agriculture is and will always be the foundation of civilisation National geographic programme: https://youtu.be/i885hopsw6E?si=azceEWaftF86WUWp Neolithic revolution • Humans slowly abandoned the hunter-gather way of life to become settled farmers – Farming evolved within the hunter-gather way of life rather than being suddenly invented • Start of settled life – development of villages. • Multiple theories have been proposed for the change in behaviour • The birth of farming marks the birth of the civilisation we now live in! Plant domestication followed the end of the most recent glacial period Glacial retreat Glacial advance Wild gathering Pre-domestication cultivation Domestication Neolithic Revolution thousand years ago How did people begin to cultivate plants? X X X It is thought to have been a gradual change from seeking and following food sources How did people begin to cultivate plants? X X It is thought to have been a gradual change from seeking and following food sources to semi settled migration How did people begin to cultivate plants? X It is thought to have been a gradual change from seeking and following food sources to semi settled migration and finally permanent settlements.

Modified from Diamond (1997) Centres of Domestication The first farming system provided a higher level of nutrition which could support much higher population densities than the hunter-gatherer could.
