Mitochondria from alphaproteobacteria Chloroplasts from cyanobacteria Lynne Margulis’ (1966) Endosymbiont Theory Origin of Eukaryotes via: Endosymbiosis of bacterial cell within an Archaeal cell? Mitochondria from alphaproteobacteria Chloroplasts from cyanobacteria Eukarya Archaea  = not yet cultured Archaea/Bacteria are the oldest living organisms (ca. 3 billion yrs old). Most are obligate anaerobes from inaccessible habitats (deep sea etc.) As more species are studied and more genes are sequenced, the shape of phylogenetic trees can change Phylogenomics (= comparison of whole genomes; £50 for bacterial genome) The genomes of Eukarya contain elements of both Archaea and Bacteria Us Bacteria Lokiarchaeota 2015 Arctic Ocean (Nth Atlantic) Cytoskeleton Protein degradation ER proteins Lokiarchaeota –metagenomes show eukaryote features (DNA only - not cultured) Williams et al., 2019 Asgard Archaea FECA (First Eukaryote Common Ancestor?) 10yr quest to culture Nature, Dec2019 Lokiarchaeum Heimdallarchaeota LC2 Heimdallarchaeota LC3 Asgard Entangle–Engulf–Endogenize (E3) model 1 m𝝻 Rodrigues-Oliviera, T. et al. Nature 613, 332–339 (2022).

Effective therapy via antiretroviral drugs (reduce transmission and halt progression to AIDS) Class examples and disease caused I – double-stranded DNA Smallpox, vaccinia, Herpes simplex II – single-stranded DNA Parvovirus III – double-stranded RNA Human rotaviruses, Colorado tick fever IV – single-stranded RNA (+) Yellow fever, Hepatitis A/C, Rubella, SARS-CoV2 V – single-stranded RNA (-) Measles, mumps, rabies, Ebola, Influenza VI – single-stranded RNA (DNA interm.) HIV, HTLV (retrovirus) VII – double-stranded DNA (RNA interm.) Hepatitis B Genetic composition of viruses RNA (+) = coding strand Expression and Replication of virus genes inside host cell By convention, the mRNA is always considered to be of the plus (+) complementarity. ssRNA viruses mutate more rapidly (eg. Flu virus evolution) STRUCTURAL PROTEINS make up the virus particle. NON STRUCTURAL PROTEINS or NS PROTEINS are enzymes needed for replication (not incorporated in the VIRION) CAPSID is the protein shell enclosing nucleic acid (made up of numerous CAPSOMERS) Capsid plus the enclosed NUCLEIC ACID is the NUCLEOCAPSID. Nucleocapsid may be enclosed in an ENVELOPE which may contain material of host cell as well as viral origin. The VIRION is the complete infective virus particle • The outer shell of a virus particle protects nucleic acid from physical, chemical, or enzymatic damage outside the host cell (e.g. UV etc). Basic components of virusesHelical capsids • Simplest way to arrange multiple, identical protein subunits (rotational symmetry) -arranged around the circumference (spiral staircase). • Multiple disks stacked on top of one another to form a cylinder • Virus genome is coated by the protein shell or contained in hollow cylinder. Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) Naked vs. Enveloped virus Penetration of an Enveloped Virus by Fusion of Its Envelope with the Host Cell Membrane. Viral envelope fuses with host cell membrane and nucleocapsid enters the host cell. Penetration of an Enveloped Virus by Endocytosis. The host cell membrane invaginates forming an endocytic vesicle and the entire virus is placed in an endocytic vesicle. PENETRATION AND UNCOATING IN ANIMAL CELLS PENETRATION IN BACTERIA (T4 phage in E. coli) 100 nm Typical bacteriophage replication cycle (eg. Phage lambda in E. coli) 1) ATTACHMENT 2) PENETRATION AND UNCOATING 3) EXPRESSION AND REPLICATION 4) ASSEMBLY 5) MATURATION 6) RELEASE Lysis vs lysogeny in bacteriophages Lytic (or virulent) phages can only multiply on bacteria and kill the cell by lysis at the end of the life cycle. Lysogenic (or temperate) phages can either multiply via the lytic cycle or enter a dormant state in the cell. In this dormant state most phage genes are in a repressed state (not transcribed)- called a prophage because it is not a phage but it has the potential to produce phage. In marine and freshwater habitats, per litre of water: - 1 000 000 000 bacteria - 10 000 000 000 bacteriophages Bacteriophages (viruses which attack bacteria) are abundant in nature Viruses control bacterial numbers in aquatic systems CRISPR-Cas9: Bacterial defence against phages Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats Acr:Anti-CRISPR gene Phage/plasmid genomes ’sampled’ by host, stored in CRISPR array and expressed as crRNA. crRNA bind to later invading phages/plasmids and Cas9 protein destroys invading DNA Landsberger et al., 2018, Cell 174, 908–916Nobel Prize Chem2020: Charpentier/Doudna Acr Phage defence Prions – a proteinaceous infectious particle Believed to be responsible for diseases such as: Scrapie: sheep and BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy): cows Humans are also susceptible to several prion diseases: CJD: Creutzfeld- Jacob Disease ; FFI: Fatal familial Insomnia END","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":""}
