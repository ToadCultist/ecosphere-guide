DegenerationPair of autosomes A A X Y X YX Y SRY Suppression of recombination • Y does not recombine with X • (except for a very small region near the tip) • Y chromosomes never meet because: • SRY is dominant for male sex determination • females never carry the Y • All males have one female parent • A male can only receive one Y (from its father) • Genes on the Y never recombine • Genes on the X can recombine in females X Y A A X X A A Y-chromosome degeneration • Y has far fewer functional genes than X • Probably due to accumulation of deleterious mutations Is the Y doomed? • In mole voles and spiny rats the Y has already been lost… • But another sex determination gene (on a different chromosome) has taken over. Recombination and linkage • Genes on different chromosomes – Assort independently at meiosis • Produce Mendelian ratios of phenotypes • Genes on the same chromosome – Only segregate when crossover occurs between them • Parental phenotypes dominate – Known as linked genes • Linkage group – Contains all genes that are linked to one another – Number of linkage groups • Should equal number of homologous chromosome pairs Genetic mapping in eukaryotes • Genetic map – Uses recombination frequency • To map order of genes on a chromosome • To estimate distance between genes – Assumes that crossovers occur randomly along length of chromosome • Map distances – Measured in centiMorgans (cM) • 1cM=1% recombination • Genes that are far apart on the same chromosome – May show 50% recombination • Cannot be distinguished from genes on different chromosomes – Subject to double crossovers • Produce non-recombinant genotypes – Cause genetic distance to be underestimated Mapping human genes • Humans • Long generation time • Low number of progeny • Test-crosses and back-crosses cannot be performed • Must rely on pedigree data • May be incomplete Mapping with molecular markers • Traditional genetic markers • Mutations produce observable characters • Colour, shape, biochemical differences, etc. • Very limited in number • Molecular markers • Variations in DNA sequence • Almost unlimited in number Limitations of genetic mapping • Groups of linked genes • Cannot be mapped to specific chromosomes • Recombination can vary • Between chromosomes • Between regions of a chromosome • Between sexes • % recombination • Does not correspond precisely to physical distance","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
