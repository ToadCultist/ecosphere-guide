{"path":"University/Lecture slides/Ecology and Conservation/Science based conservation.pdf","text":"Science-based conservation Joe Ironside Aims and approaches • Aims • To identify species and populations at greatest risk of extinction • Approaches • Declining population paradigm • Seek to understand causes of population decline • Small population paradigm • Seek to understand negative consequences of existing in a small population Habitat loss • Major cause of species decline • But not usually directly responsible for species extinction • Associated with economic development and human population growth • Requires understanding of economics, sociology and psychology • Requires engagement with population planning Species-area relationship • Relationship between habitat areas and number of species • Derived from studies of islands • Equilibrium between rates of immigration and extinction of species • Allows prediction of extinction rate when habitat is lost Example: diversity and abundance in Amazon rainforest since 1979 • Examined fragments of 1, 10 and 100 ha: • Substantial loss of diversity of dung beetles in smaller patches • 50% in 1 ha patches • 30% in 10 ha patches • 15% in 100 ha patches • Concomitant decline of insectivorous birds and dung beetles Habitat fragmentation • Reduces amount of habitat available • Reduces number of species • Results in larger number of smaller habitat patches • More edge habitat • Less interior habitat • Will affect species differently • Depending on habitat preferences • Increases isolation of habitat patches Habitat matrix • Patches of high-quality habitat • In matrix of lower quality habitat • May be more or less hospitable • Depending on ecology of species • Landscape management • May enable species to migrate between patches • E.g. by connecting them with corridors How much habitat is enough? • Scientific approach • develop models to predict area required • To sustain viable population for long period of time • In reality • Non-scientific criteria are often used to establish size and shape of reserves Monitoring habitat destruction • Habitat destruction • Monitored using satellite remote sensing • E.g. Amazon rainforest • Satellite monitoring systems • Detect forest fires and changes in vegetation • Can alert authorities to illegal activity in real-time Metapopulations • Sub-populations • Occupy habitat fragments • May be connected by migration • To greater or lesser extent • Conservation management strategies • May focus on • Single subpopulation • Entire metapopulation • Threats may be very different • Landscape scale conservation • Reserve networks • Reintroductions • Translocations • Reserve corridors Example: Checkerspot butterfly (Euphydryas editha) in coastal California • One large population (> 400,000 individuals) • many small populations (< 500 individuals) • Unusual weather events • can eliminate all small populations simultaneously • Large population persists • Provides source for recolonisation of small populations Impacts of climate change • Climate has always changed • Species have survived by moving or adapting • Current climate change is rapid • Species may not be able to adapt or move quickly enough • Habitats have been destroyed and fragmented • Species may have nowhere to move to Bioclimatic envelope models • Show relationship between species distribution and climate • Used to predict species extinctions when climate changes Simulated redistribution of suitable climate space for stiff sedge (Carex bigelowii) under future climate scenarios in Great Britain and Ireland as predicted by the SPECIES model.
