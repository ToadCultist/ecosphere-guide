A wonderful creature is the Ainwba, one of the lowliest of the lowest class of animals, a mere speck of the thinnest jelly endowed with the usual attributes of all living things. Possessing an extensile and contractile power, it puts forth portions of its ma- terial in any direction; which portions act as temporary instru- ments of locomotion and prehension, and which again withdrawn, melt away in the common mass without leaving a trace of their previous existence. The human body with its intricate mechanism and appliances is a theme of incessant wonder and admiration, but the Anyzba in its simplicity of structure and capabilities may reasonably excite the same feelings. Though it has long been known, it has recently acquired new interest, from the discovery in higher animals of jelly-specks which in structure and endowments are undis- tinguishable from the free Amwaba of stagnant waters. The white corpuscles of the blood travel through the tissues of our body as independent beings, just as the Aimzwba creeps in the mud of a pool, and so alike are they that the wandering corpuscles ap- pear as if they were parasitic AHnmbc. With such a creature as an Anzwba, of the utmost simplicity, a globule when quiet; of the most variable and ever changing shape when moving, one would not anticipate the recognition of different kinds, of the character of the more fixed specific forms of higher animals. Nevertheless, we observe, Aminba varying greatly in size, in the general habitual shape they assume in mo- tion, in the extent and usual form of the locomotive prolonga- tions, and in some other points, ordinarily sufficient to render dif- ferent kinds distinguishable from one another. Many naturalists think that all varieties of Amwebe are transi- tory phases of one and the same species, and this view is in some measure confirmed by the occurrence of intermediate or transi- tionary forms which make it impossible, in many cases, strictly to define the limits of more characteristic and striking forms such as we commonly find. The same reasoning, however, applies with more or less force to higher organic forms, and as with these, it is at least convenient to refer to the different kinds of Amwrb as so many named species. VOL. XII-NO. IV. 17 236 Amnxbc Proteus. [April, The first notice we have of the discovery of an Azinzba, is by Rosel, in a work entitled \" Insecten Belustigung,\" or Recreation among Insects, published in Nurnberg in I755. R6sel calls the animal the little Proteus, and accompanies his description with colored figures engraved by himself. Linnceus, in the Systema Naturoc, referring to R6sel's animal, named it TVolvox CGiaos, and afterwards CGiaos Prothieus. Nearly at the same time Pallas called it Volvox Proteus. Miller subsequently gave it the name of Volvoxr Sp/haerul, but latest after having him- self observed the animal, described and figured it under the name Pirotcus diffiuens. As the generic name of Proteus had been previously appropri- ated for the well known salamandroid of Adelsberg, Bory de St. Vincent substituted that of Amiba for the animal of R6sel and 1iiller, calling it by the various names of Amib(a divergens, A. EOseli and A. _AUilderi. In 1830, Ehrenberg described a comparatively small Amwba, which together with all others previously noticed by different au- thors, he referred to the same species under the name of Amwba dizffluens. In 183 1, in the Transactions of the Academy of Sciences, of Berlin, p. 79, Ehrenberg described what he considered to be a new species of A4nwba with the name of A. princess. Its charac- ters are as follows: \" diameter i-6th of a line; body transparent, yellowishwith many readily and voluntarily movable blunt pro- cesses, four times larger than the Proteos.\" In I 838, in his great work, the Infusionsthierchen, Ehrenberg described Amxbu prin- ceps as \" large, yellowish, equaling i-6th of a line, provided with a variable number of cylindrical appendages, thick and rounded at the end.\" Accompanying, the former description there is also one of Amwba dijifiiCns as follows: \" diameter 1-24th of a line, body clear as water, with mostly three or four variable processes; four times less than the former species.\" In the Infusionsthierchen the same is described, as \" branching, rarely extending or exceed- ing I-24th of a line, colorless, with processes variable, moderately long, robust, and subacute.\" From the descriptions it appears to me that R6sel's little Pr-oteus accords with Ehrenberg's Ain(bc7 princess, and not with Amxba diffluens. Ehrenberg says A. przinceps is four times larger than the Prot/eus, meaning A. ijffluiens, and not the Proteus of R6sel, for 1878. ] Aeebta Proteus. 237 this as represented by R6sel is of greater size than that given by Ehrenberg to A. fpriceps. It would naturally be supposed that an Aiu'baP discovered by the earliest observers, with instruments less perfect than those later in use, would be one of the larger and more common forms. That such was the case appears fairly proved by both figures and descriptions. R6sel, referring to a figure of his little Proteus, remarks that in its 'natural size it looks like fig. A. Now this represents the ani- mal in its quiescent state, in globular form, and the figure measures four-fifths of a line. No A cmba heas since been recorded so large as this, and we may look upon the figure as somewhat exag- gerated., which might readily have occurred without the accurate measuring instruments which came later into application to micro- scopic objects. R6sel also refers to his having held the Proteuts at rest with the point of a feather, so that the evidence is suffi- cient to prove that the Amnwba was one of the largest kind. Taking size alone into consideration, R-5sel's Proteus is as far removed in one direction from Ehrenberg's A41uexba priuceps, as Ain(ebat diffites is in the opposite direction. But in other char- acters R6sel's Pr-oteus agrees with the former closely, and not with the latter. Ehrenberg describes A. priuceps as yellowish, the A. diffilels as colorless. R6sel says nothing of the color of the Protezs, but his figures are colored yellowish. Most of Rasel's figures exhibit the characteristic changes of form of the animal in movement, and of one of these he remarks that in its branching it resembles the antlers of the deer. As regards the concurrence of size and color of R6sel's Proteus, it might apply to other large Amzwbce, instead of A. priuceps, as for instance the A. villosae of Wallich, or the Pelomy/lra pedustI-is of Greef, but the changes of form represented as occurring in the Potezus of R6sel, approach it rather to the former than to either of the latter. Mffller's descriptions and figures of Proteus dfZzueus, which that author regarded the same as R6sel's Proteus, likewise appear to apply to the same animal named A. priunceps by Ehrenberg, rather than to that which he named A. diffluens. If the views taken, as above expressed, are correct, it must be admitted that the Auurbetopriuceps of Ehrenberg is the same ani- mal as the Proteus dizffluens of Muller and the little Proteus of 238 Recent Literature. [April, R6sel. Even consenting to the opinion that all forms of Amwbw may eventually be shown to be transitory phases of the same species, it does not render the determinations of Ehrenberg and his followers, in regard to A. pri'nceps and A. defifuens, any the less incorrect. Arriving at the conclusion that the common large Amnwba, usually assigned to A. prbzceps is the same as the Proteus of R6sel, the question arises as to its appropriate name. Of the specific names employed for the little Proteus, that of \" Chaos\" is the oldest, but appears to me less appropriate than that of \"Pro- teus\" applied afterwards. As the latter cannot be used in its generic sense, it might be accepted in its specific application so as to perpetuate the name given to the animal by R6sel, its discov- erer. While, therefore, in strict conformity with the rules of zoological nomenclature, the little Proteus of R6sel, the Proteus dijX'uens of Muller, and the Amwfba princeps of Ehrenberg, would be called Anmacba chaos, I would suggest that it should be called A mw ba piroteus. :o: RECENT LITERATURE. MONTEIRO's ANGOLA AND THE RIVER CONGO.'-Now that Mr. Stanley has discovered the source of the Congo, and crossed the continent to the Coast of Angola, one will turn to the present book for the excellent account it gives of a region so little known. The country described by the author lies between the River Zaire or Congo and Mosammedes or Little Fish bay, comprising ten degrees of latitude. In this region, an interesting and rich part of tropical Africa, Mr. Monteiro lived and journeyed for many years. How the lowland country of the. Angola coast may strike the stranger, and how the traveler journeys through its unique scenery, may be ascertained by a glance at the view here given. A number of similar full-page engravings adorn the book, which is full of interesting information regarding the country and its people, their manners and customs, and the effects of slavery upon them. All books of this sort sooner or later exhaust the human features of the country, and we are then regaled with in- teresting notes regarding the animals and plants, many of them so strange and striking. Some of the characteristic insects are rep- 1 Ang ola and the River Congo. By JOACHIM JOHN MONTEIRO. With map and illustrations. New York. McMillau & Co. I876.
