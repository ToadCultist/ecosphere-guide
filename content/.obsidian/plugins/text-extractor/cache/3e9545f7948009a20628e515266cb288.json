Jo Hamilton (e-mail: jvh) Objectives and Learning Outcomes  Evolutionary origins & trends in mammals.  Mammalian adaptations for lactation & suckling.  Key features of mammals.  Diversity of mammals. – Additional material on Bb: mammalian diversity, phylogeny & hominin/hominid evolution. Recap: The early mammals. – Insectivorous? – Nocturnal  E.g. Megazostrodon – Solitary? – Large olfactory lobes  More sophisticated sensory processing than cynodonts? – Evolution of lactation  No nipples  Antimicrobial role of milk?  Nest protection for oviparous mammals. http://www.nhm.ac.uk/ Evolution of lactation & suckling.  Evolution of precise occlusion & diphyodonty – Dyphyodonty precedes precise occlusion – Reduce number of sets teeth if fed on milk – Liquid food allows jaw growth & eruption of permanent teeth in almost adult sized jaw.  If animal has precise occlusion & dyphyodonty it must have 1st evolved lactation. Lactation appeared with evolution of mammals.  Lactation – Separation offspring seasonal food supply. – Paternal care not required. – Care outside uterus E.g. marsupials.  Suckling – mammalian feature – Seal – bony hard palate, tongue, epiglottis. – Breathing & swallowing. – Facial muscles – mammalian characteristic  Mobile lips & cheeks. http://ansci.illinois.edu/static/ansc438/Lactation/ marsupials.html https://www.flickr.com/photos/markeveleigh/11001 9695 Mammals are amniotes that have hair and produce milk Key features  Lactation (only therians have nipples).  Hair/fur – insulation, camouflage, sensation, communication.  Variety skin glands – apocrine, eccrine & sebaceaous – lubrication, waterproofing, olfactory communication & thermoregulation.  Evolution mammary glands from skin glands.

On successful completion of this module students should be able to:  Describe genetic processes at all levels of organisation (e.g. molecular, chromosomal, population) with reference to appropriate structures and concepts.  Carry out genetic experiments in the laboratory, using appropriate equipment and techniques, and analyse and interpret the resulting data.  Outline the key phases in the evolution of life on Earth, describe the evolution of major groups of organisms and identify the anatomical links between extinct and living life forms. Objectives and learning outcomes. On successful completion of this module students should be able to:  Compare and contrast the morphology and anatomy of the major groups, be able to identify representatives of the groups and describe their key features and physiological adaptations in the context of environmental conditions.  Explain how different biological classification systems are defined and used and describe the diversity and evolutionary history of a taxon of organisms through the construction of a basic phylogenetic tree and accompanying narrative.
