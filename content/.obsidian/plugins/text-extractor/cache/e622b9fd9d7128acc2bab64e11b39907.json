{"path":"University/Assignments/Botany practical report/Botany Practical Report.pdf","text":"Botany Practical Report Introduction This report aims to look at the effects of drought on three plants: Vicia faba (a crop species with no drought adaptations), Brophyllum daigremontianum (from Madagascar, a very dry region) and Iris pseudacorus (a freshwater species). As well as aiming to look at the differences in drought response. This is crucial as with rising global temperatures, and more frequent drought, to understand the adaptations to drought and which plants are better suited, will potentially help to adapt to climate changes effects. Methods Materials Three mature plant species were grown in a glasshouse used, Vicia faba, Brophyllum daigremontianum and Iris pseudacorus. Each plant underwent a drought treatment, meaning it was not watered for 7 days, and a control, which was watered daily. Methods Three plants of the control and treatment groups, of each species were sampled. 10 mm diameter discs were sampled from the same region of each plant, and weighed immediately. The disks were left to float in water for 45 minutes. Then once blotted, they were reweighed. Relative water content (RWC) was then calculated [(freshweight/turgid weight) * 100]. Results. explain what they show and content Figure 1. Box plot of RWC of three drought treated plant species Centre lines show the medians; box limits indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles as determined by R software; whiskers extend 1.5 times the interquartile range from the 25th and 75th percentiles, outliers are represented by dots; crosses represent sample means; data points are plotted as open circles. n = 159 sample points. Overall comparing each species RWC, and how much water they take up Overall, the control groups had a significant difference between their RWC. With means of: 69.193 (Vicia faba), 75.044 (Iris pseudacorus), and 92.844 (Brophyllum daigremontianum), shown in Table 1. When an ANOVA test was conducted between the control groups RWC, there was a significant difference between the three control species (t-test, p < 0.001) with a significance level of 5%. This demonstrates that there is a difference in how the species uptake water. A Tukey HSD test was carried out afterwards, showing where the significant difference was within the control species. It showed Vicia faba control vs Brophyllum daigremontianum control had a p value of P<.01. Similarly, Vicia faba control vs Iris pseudacorus control had a p value of P<.01. Finally Brophyllum daigremontianum control vs Iris pseudacorus control had a p value of P<.01. This shows that each species is different from each other respectively, in how they uptake water. Figure one shows how each plant responded to drought treatment. The There are outliers Individual species reacted to drought differently. individual drought vs control, showing less water was taken up etc. Unpaired t-test (5% significance level) There was a significant difference between the control and treatment groups RWC for Vicia faba (t-test, p < 0.0001) There was not a significant difference between the control and treatment groups RWC for Bryophyllum daigremontianum (t-test, p = 0.4398) There was not a significant difference between the control and treatment groups RWC for Iris pseudacorus (t-test, p = 0.2993) ANOVA There was a significant difference between the three control species (t-test, p < 0.001) Tukey HSD Vica control vs Bryoph. control P<.01 Vica control vs Iris control P<.01 Bryoph. control vs Iris control P<.01 All three samples within control group are significantly different. This shows that there is a difference in how they uptake water. Discussion Review results with context of knowledge How well did each species do to drought Was anything unexpected, talk about each result. Have aims and objectives been met? Discuss the aims from the intro, Limitations of experiment What would we do differently next time Overall paragraph â€“ no new information The higher the RWC the lower the water uptake","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
