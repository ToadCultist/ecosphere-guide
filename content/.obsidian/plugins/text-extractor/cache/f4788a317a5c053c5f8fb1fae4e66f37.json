Chapter 9.1 – 9.4 (pages 214 - 230) Morris et al. Chapter 9 (pages 179 - 197) 2 – Hormones and scales of signalling Communication between cells The signaling cell releases signaling molecules. Signaling molecule Receptor The responding cell has receptor proteins that bind to the signaling molecule. Signaling cell Responding cell Basic model of cellular signalling usually has four components • Signalling cell • Signalling compound • Receptor (usually a protein) • Responding cell We will consider four types of intercellular signalling which are classified according to whether the cells are close, or further apart. • Contact-dependent signalling (touching) • Autocrine (self) • Paracrine (adjacent, side-by-side) • Endocrine (within the organism) Contact-Dependent Signalling A membrane protein on the surface of one cell acts as the signaling molecule Receptor Signaling cell Responding cell • Contact-dependent Signalling (touching) • Autocrine (self) • Paracrine (adjacent, side-by-side) • Endocrine (within the organism) Eg. Contact-dependent signalling: Neuron development in zebrafish embryos. In unspecialised neuro-epithelial cells, one cell becomes differentiated into a neuron and inhibits the neighbouring cells from doing the same via a membrane-bound signal / receptor interaction Z. Hadjivasiliou, RE. Moore, R. McIntosh, GL. Galea, J.D.W. Clarke, P, Alexandre (2019). Basal Protrusions Mediate Spatiotemporal Patterns of Spinal Neuron Differentiation, Developmental Cell, Volume 49, Issue 6, Pages 907-919 Arms of developing neuron grow out sideways to contact / inhibit more cells of neuroepithelium Autocrine signalling The signaling cell and the responding cell are the same. • Contact-dependent Signalling (touching) • Autocrine (self) • Paracrine (adjacent, side-by-side) • Endocrine (within the organism) An example of autocrine signalling is ‘quorum sensing’ in bacteria In this case, each cell is both a signalling and a responding cell but the basic four component pattern remains the same. Controls many behaviours of bacteria Eg. DNA exchange, light emission, toxin production Receptor Bacterial cell Signaling molecule Paracrine signalling Typically short range (20 cell diameters or less) The signaling molecule is normally small and highly soluble in water. Needs to travel a short distance in order to bind to the responding cell’s receptor • Contact-dependent Signalling (touching) • Autocrine (self) • Paracrine (adjacent, side-by-side) • Endocrine (within the organism) Example of paracrine signalling is propagation of a nerve impulse across a synapse via a neurotransmitter. Eg. Acetylcholine https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLS84OoHJnQ (3 min 18 sec) Acetylcholine binds to the receptor. Channel opens. Na ions (orange circles) flow through the membrane to initiate next action potential in neurone. 1. Ion Channel Receptor 2. Na Ions 3. Ligand (eg. acetylcholine) Watch the video of the neuromuscular junction and how acetylcholine triggers an excitation potential in post-synaptic membranes via ligand-controled ion channels https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLyrTOPLmbM (25 sec – 1 min 20) Endocrine signaling Signal travels through the circulatory system. Signaling molecule = hormone Receptor protein The signaling molecules may need to travel great distances in the body through the circulatory system. Signalling molecules are called hormones • Contact-dependent Signalling (touching) • Autocrine (self) • Paracrine (adjacent, side-by-side) • Endocrine (within the organism) • They are peptides, amines or steroids • Secreted as needed. Not stored, excess is excreted • Secretion regulated by autonomic nerves or by chemical feedback • Transported in the blood • Some cause rapid changes (adrenalin/epinephrine) • Some cause slower, long-term effects like growth, change in behaviour eg. sex hormones • Not enzymes and do not catalyse any reactions • Function by stimulating or inhibiting the target cells /organs. Endocrine signalling is mediated by hormones which have the following characteristics: Eg. Regulation of blood glucose by insulin and glucagon (eg of homeostasis) Response Stimulus Sensor Effector High blood glucose (right after a meal) Pancreas Insulin Body cells take up glucose Muscle and liver take up glucose and store it as glycogen Decrease in blood glucose Increase in blood glucose Muscle and liver break down glycogen and release glucose Glucagon Pancreas Low blood glucose (several hours after a meal) + – + ++ – Exocrine glands Endocrine glands Secretory cells Duct Secretory cells Capillaries The pancreas is an organ with both exo- and endocrine functions Pancreatic juice (exocrine) and insulin/glucagon (endocrine) Mammalian hormones fall into three chemical classes: Peptides, amines and steroids Peptide and amine hormones tend to be hydrophilic, they cannot easily diffuse across the plasma membrane. Detected by cell-surface (transmembrane) receptors. Steroid hormones are membrane permeable, they diffuse freely across the cell membrane to bind with receptors in the cytoplasm. Classes of HormonesPeptide hormones Oxytocin Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) Amine hormones are derived from aromatic amino acids. All four shown here are derived from phenylalanine. Amine hormones L-dopa Dopamine Norepinephrine Epinephrine Steroid hormones Progesterone Testosterone Cortisol Cholesterol Insulin So far we have talked about intercellular (cell to cell) communication Signaling molecule Receptor Signaling cell Responding cell Receptor ? ? What happens in the responding cell after the signalling molecule becomes linked to the receptor? = Intracellular signalling Plasma membrane of target cell Receptor Peptide hormones Peptide /amine hormones use cell-surface receptors Steroid hormones use intracellular receptors Steroid hormone New protein mRNA Receptor protein Nucleus DNA Hormone-receptor complex Steps in intracellular Signaling The signal binds to a cell-surface (or cytoplasmic) receptor, which is then activated. Receptor activation Signal transduction Response Termination Plasma membrane Extracellular fluid Cytoplasm The signal is transmitted to the interior of the cell by a signal transduction pathway. The cell responds, for example by activating an enzyme or turning on transcription of a gene. The response is terminated and the system reset so that new signals can be received.","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":""}
