Submission information Online, using Turnitin via the Blackboard module pages. Word/length limit Within 1500 words excluding headings, references and legends for figures and tables. Marks will be deducted for submissions that exceed the word limit. Learning Outcomes to be addressed by the coursework: Describe the diversity and evolutionary history of a taxon of organisms through the construction of a basic phylogenetic tree and accompanying narrative. Written assignments MUST be in your own words. Do NOT take short cuts by copying even the smallest amount of material from anywhere (including the internet, books or another student’s text). This is plagiarism and will be detected. N.B. Presenting work generated by AI as if it were your own is Unacceptable Academic Practice and you must not do this. AU procedures and penalties for 'Unacceptable Academic Practice' are strict and some may prevent you from qualifying for your degree see: https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/academic-registry/handbook/regulations/uap/ Electronic Submission  (1) Choose an appropriate file name for your work. We recommend that you use the Module Code and Coursework Title – do not include your name as work is marked Page 1 of 7 Cyfadran y Gwyddorau Daear a Bywyd / Faculty of Earth and Life Sciences anonymously. Save your work in Microsoft Office or PDF format. (2) Upload the file to Turnitin by selecting ‘Upload’. (3) Check the file submitted is the correct one and the formatting on the preview page is correct. (4) Complete your submission by selecting ‘Submit’. Guidance on downloading your Turnitin receipt can be found here.  Please note that the ‘Blackboard Assignment’ submission points do not provide receipts.  Unless otherwise noted above, Turnitin allows you to overwrite your submissions. You are advised to submit your work at least once as a draft well before the deadline in case of last- minute problems.  Failure to follow this advice may result in a mark of zero if your submission is not uploaded or is in an unreadable format. Clarification of coursework brief It is your responsibility to ensure that you understand the requirements of the coursework that has been set. AU staff policy is to reply to emails within three working days so you should not expect a response in time to help if you ask for guidance less than three days before the deadline. University policy on late/non-submission Work submitted after the deadline without an approved extension will be given a mark of zero. Extension to coursework deadlines Extensions may be awarded in exceptional circumstances, e.g. on medical grounds, or for genuine, unforeseen personal circumstances such as illness, family problems or death of a relative or close personal friend. You may apply for an extension using the Extension Request Form available to download from the ‘Undergraduate Information’ or ‘Information for Taught PG Students’ module on Blackboard. This should be submitted together with any supporting documentary evidence such as a medical certificate to fsestaff@aber.ac.uk . In order to be awarded an extension, you should submit the Extension Request Form (with appropriate evidence) at least three working days before the deadline. If insufficient evidence is submitted, then the extension may be awarded subject to further evidence being provided by a given date. Failure of computers, printers and backups etc. will not be accepted as reasons for late submission of assessed work. If an extension is granted you should follow the advice on submission provided by FELS Extension team. Please refer to your handbook for further information on Coursework Extensions. If an extension has not been confirmed, then you should always submit an attempt of the work by the deadline. Page 2 of 7 Cyfadran y Gwyddorau Daear a Bywyd / Faculty of Earth and Life Sciences The assignment is based on the work carried out from both weeks of the computer-based practicals. Complete each of the following: 1) Create a Word document and copy / paste the completed results table to show your results of the analysis of characters mapped onto the three phylogenetic trees (12%): RESULTS TABLE (to be copied to your Word document) Number of Steps Type Character Tree 1 Tree 2 Tree 3 Morpho Adult weight female Adult weight male Body length female Body length male Larval weight female Larval weight male Repr Generations per season Reproduction rate Etho Nest built of Nest cells Eco Larval food type Trophic rank Trophic specialisation Total number of steps 0 0 0 Page 3 of 7 Cyfadran y Gwyddorau Daear a Bywyd / Faculty of Earth and Life Sciences 2) Based on your results answer the following questions (12%): a. Which (if any) phylogenetic tree(s) represent the most parsimonious reconstruction of the evolutionary history of the characters examined? Explain your answer. b. How many characters require fewer evolutionary steps on the most parsimonious phylogenetic tree(s) compared to the other phylogenetic tree(s)? List these characters. c. Which characters are least informative for choosing between the three phylogenies? (i.e. which are the characters that had the same score for all three trees). d. Which types of characters (morphological, reproductive, ethological or ecological) would you recommend for reconstructing the phylogeny of the Aculeata (stinging wasps, bees and ants)? Why? 3) Insert the phylogenetic tree that you reconstructed from the DNA of the Aculeata (from the second practical) into your report (Word document) (10%). 4) Based on the phylogeny reconstructed from the DNA sequences, answer the following questions (12%): a. Which of the three phylogenetic trees from the first practical matches the phylogeny that you reconstructed from the DNA sequences (from the second computer-based practical)? b. Which phenotypic characters required fewer evolutionary steps on the phylogenetic tree that you reconstructed from DNA (from the second computer-based practical) compared to the other trees? List these characters. c. Which phenotypic characters from the first practical required more evolutionary steps on the phylogenetic tree that you reconstructed from DNA (from the second computer-based practical) compared to the other trees? List these characters. Page 4 of 7 Cyfadran y Gwyddorau Daear a Bywyd / Faculty of Earth and Life Sciences d. Which types of characters (morphological, reproductive, ethological or ecological) match best with the phylogeny of the Aculeata reconstructed from DNA? 5) Using evidence to support your arguments (from the lectures and your own outside reading) discuss what the phylogenetic tree reconstructed from DNA tells us about the evolution of the Aculeata? You should use the literature to support your arguments and you must cite and reference your sources appropriately. (54%) Hints and tips for question 5: This question is specifically about the tree that you reconstructed from DNA in the second computer-based practical. Points to consider: What does this tree tell us about the Aculeata (i.e. how do you interpret the tree)? Which species shared a common ancestor, which are sister taxa, which groups are more closely related to each other, etc? Can you find information from the literature that supports your interpretation? E.g. Does the evolutionary history you reconstructed, match with what other studies have said about this group? From the literature: Which families/genera/species are members of the Aculeata and what morphological and physiological features are special in this group? Does the phylogenetic tree you reconstructed say something about the types of behaviours that have evolved in this group and the order in which they evolved? This question allows you to demonstrate that you understand and can interpret the phylogenetic tree from the point of view of a diagram representing the evolutionary history of a group (or taxon), and that you can research extra information and use it to support or critique your results. You should use the literature to support your arguments and you must cite and reference your sources appropriately. Please refer back to information from your year 1 tutor-led skills module and the Using References guidance for correct citation and reference format. Page 5 of 7 Cyfadran y Gwyddorau Daear a Bywyd / Faculty of Earth and Life Sciences Assessment Criteria Specified assessment criteria will be used to evaluate your submitted coursework. The criteria used for this piece of work will include: Knowledge, Analysis, Literature, Evaluation, Scholarship, Structure, Communication, Data presentation, Data analysis. A full description of each of the assessment criteria, including the different levels of attainment (between 0 and 100%) are available in the Department of Life Sciences Undergraduate Information DEPT-I-UG-O folder on Blackboard. You can also access the assessment criteria for your assignment by following the instructions in the following FAQ: https://faqs.aber.ac.uk/index.php?id=9271 NOTE: The assessment criteria levels of attainment are not used to calculate your mark, they provide formative feedback for you to see how you could improve your work. In addition to this formative feedback, you will also be provided with written or recorded comments from your marker.
