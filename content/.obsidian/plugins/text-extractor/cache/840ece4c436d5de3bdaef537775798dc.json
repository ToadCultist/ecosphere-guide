Identify and describe biological molecules, relating their structure to their function. Written assignments MUST be in your own words. Do NOT take short cuts by copying even the smallest amount of material from anywhere (including the internet, books or another student’s text). This is plagiarism and will be detected. N.B. Presenting work generated by AI as if it were your own is Unacceptable Academic Practice and you must not do this. AU procedures and penalties for 'Unacceptable Academic Practice' are strict and some may prevent you from qualifying for your degree see: https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/academic-registry/handbook/regulations/uap/ Electronic Submission  (1) Choose an appropriate file name for your work. We recommend that you use the Module Code and Coursework Title – do not include your name as work is marked anonymously. Save your work in Microsoft Office or PDF format. (2) Upload the file to Turnitin by selecting ‘Upload’. (3) Check the file submitted is the correct one and the formatting on the preview page is correct. (4) Complete your submission by selecting ‘Submit’. Guidance on downloading your Turnitin receipt can be found here.  Please note that the ‘Blackboard Assignment’ submission points do not provide receipts.  Unless otherwise noted above, Turnitin allows you to overwrite your submissions.

Clarification of coursework brief It is your responsibility to ensure that you understand the requirements of the coursework that Page 1 of 4 Cyfadran y Gwyddorau Daear a Bywyd / Faculty of Earth and Life Sciences has been set. AU staff policy is to reply to emails within three working days so you should not expect a response in time to help if you ask for guidance less than three days before the deadline. University policy on late/non-submission Work submitted after the deadline without an approved extension will be given a mark of zero. Extension to coursework deadlines Extensions may be awarded in exceptional circumstances, e.g. on medical grounds, or for genuine, unforeseen personal circumstances such as illness, family problems or death of a relative or close personal friend. You may apply for an extension using the Extension Request Form available to download from the ‘Undergraduate Information’ or ‘Information for Taught PG Students’ module on Blackboard. This should be submitted together with any supporting documentary evidence such as a medical certificate to fsestaff@aber.ac.uk . In order to be awarded an extension, you should submit the Extension Request Form (with appropriate evidence) at least three working days before the deadline. If insufficient evidence is submitted, then the extension may be awarded subject to further evidence being provided by a given date. Failure of computers, printers and backups etc. will not be accepted as reasons for late submission of assessed work. If an extension is granted you should follow the advice on submission provided by FELS Extension team. Please refer to your handbook for further information on Coursework Extensions. If an extension has not been confirmed, then you should always submit an attempt of the work by the deadline.
