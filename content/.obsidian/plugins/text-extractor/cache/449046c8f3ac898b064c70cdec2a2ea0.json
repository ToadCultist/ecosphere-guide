It will disappear from some of the more southerly areas where we now find it Plants are also restricted by low temperatures Olive Olea sativa Olive distribution Small-leaved lime Tilia cordata Umbilicus rupestris (Salisb.)

Recent history of a species may affect the responses of a plant or animal to an environmental situation Plants and animals can sometimes ‘acclimate’ Acclimation temperature (°C)Lethal temperature (°C) ONCORHYNCHUS KETA AMEIURUS NEBULOSUS Lethal temperature relations for two species of fish Bullhead (Ameiurus sp.) is a highly tolerant species compared to the chum salmon (Oncorhynchus sp.) Area enclosed by each trapezium: zone of tolerance • Deserts and lack of water determining species distribution • These may be natural phenomena, or caused by human activity, and can readily be seen from the air WaterEuphorbia Opuntia sp. (prickly pear) Scots Pine Norway Spruce Oak Beech Pedunculate Oak Forget- Me-Not Opuntia Hard-leaved Soft-leaved SucculentSpecific survival time (h)Too little water is a problem for some species - whilst too much can be a problem for others Oak Quercus spp. Beech (Fagus sylvatica) Light Physical structure • The distribution of pocket gophers in Colorado is affected by soil • They are only tolerant of deep soils of fine sands Physical structure Distribution, does not only depend on soil characteristics but also on competition between the species on soils that they all tolerate. Chemical composition Comparing soils, derived from acid rocks (e.g. granite) with soils derived from basic rocks (e.g. limestone, dolomite) it can be seen they have different chemical characteristics. Soils derived from: Dolomite Sandstone Granite Soil moisture Highest High Lowest pH Alkaline Slightly acidic More acidic Soil nutrients Very low low Low Soil temperature Low Higher Higher Pinus aristata % cover 15.4 3.6 1.8 Artemisia tridentata (sagebrush) % cover 0.6 11.1 16.6 • They have abiotic (physical, chemical) & biotic properties (living organisms: invertebrates, fungi, bacteria) • Soil has a marked effect on the plant species that will grow in a particular area • It is often difficult to work out which factor is affecting plant distribution. Indeed it may often be several Soils are complex systems Aspect Can be clearly seen in Rocky Mountains of Colorado Island of Sandray, Outer HebridesNorth facing face • Animals more complicated than plants as they move & may change their distribution • Animals can be affected by changes in behaviour • These changes can be brought about by environmental factors Explaining distribution Chipping sparrow is a small bird of North America “Normal habitat” is coniferous woodland % TIME SPENT IN: CHIPPING SPARROWS “PINE” “OAK” Wild-caught adults 71 29 Laboratory-reared, no foliage exposure 67 33 Laboratory-reared, oak foliage exposure only 46 54 Oak Pine NO FOLIAGE Chipping sparrow North Uist Animals are also important as grazersSummary • Wide range of abiotic factors dictate & limit distribution of individual species • Geographical factors limit populations, but many have been alleviated in recent years • Soil dictates habitats, but can also dictate animal populations • Animals are mobile & therefore can respond more rapidly to change at a particular location compared to plants References and acknowledgements: • Kruuk, H.
