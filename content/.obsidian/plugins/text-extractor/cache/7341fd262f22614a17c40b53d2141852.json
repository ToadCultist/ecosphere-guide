Pomarine skua - O Parasitic skua - ∆ Snowy owl - □ Pitelka returned next year (1953)Dramatic fluctuations in predatory bird populations – why? • High density (1897, 1953) • Low density (1913, 1915, 1952) • Summer environment had not changed • Temperature not significantly different between years • Was it food availability? Snowy owl with chick feeding on lemming prey What do tundra predators eat?Lemmings at Point Barrow Brown lemming (Lemmus trimucronatus) • Lemming species in this area are ‘sedentary’ & do not migrate at times of high numbers Baby brown lemming Point Barrow has more lemming predators Juvenile arctic foxes TUNDRA VEGETATION Lemmings Lemmus and Dicrostonyx Red fox Pomarine skuaArctic fox Least weaselShort- tailed weasel Long-tailed skua Parasitic skua Short- eared owl Snowy owl Glaucous gull Tundra ‘food web’Two lemming species at Point Barrow Collared lemming Dicrostonyx groelandicus Brown lemming Lemmus trimucronatus What do we know about their ecology? • Not evenly distributed across the landscape • Tend to occur in specific locations ‘Ice polygons’ important habitat features Musk oxen near ice polygons Ice polygons • Edges are shallow troughs • In summer, these have some water at bottom, resting on ice wedge Ice polygons & lemmings • Lemming burrows in better-drained ramparts & slopes of troughs • Most vulnerable to skuas when feeding in open centre areas • In winter, lemmings live in snow tunnels (-2/3°C), which are warmer than surface (-20/30°C) • But what do they eat?

Lemmings & quality of vegetation - Schulz (1960s) High lemming numbers  high P in vegetation • Why and how do levels of P in vegetation fluctuate? P in vegetation Lemmings P distribution in soil • P concentrated in top 3 or 4 cm • Other nutrients distributed differently; e.g. more Mg in lower levels • Added P to the soil as fertiliser to see whether higher numbers of lemmings could be sustained in “non- lemming” years • A fence was erected, but this time the lemmings were not removed • The area inside the exclosure was fertilised, the area outside was left as a control Shultz then: Lemmings and tissue quality Control (outside) Fertilised (inside) 0.25 72 nests/ha Breeding lemming density Exclosure experiment • Low density of nests outside exclosure • Nest density higher inside, where treated with fertiliser Permafrost Roots are in active layer where P is concentrated SNOW Heavy lemming grazing → warming of soil... ... P levels in plant fall WARMER Permafrost Heavy lemming grazing → warms soil & lowers permafrost Roots grow past P active zone & P content of plant material (lemming food) falls Lemming populations decline Skua populations decline Not so permafrost: 2050 global warming? • Arctic expected to warm by 8oC Permafrost melt could dictate animal populations Roots will grow past active zone and P levels of plants will be lower Smaller lemming population Effects on skua population •Tundra ecosystems: globally important both in terms of biodiversity and global carbon stores •Plants and animals exist & are adapted to the extreme environmental conditions and these simple systems provide us with an excellent model to start to understand how ecosystems might work •Skua populations vary significantly between years due to fluctuations in Lemming populations •High lemming numbers associated with high P in diet •Roots only grow and are active in the unfrozen soil •Phosphate is concentrated in the upper soil horizons •When vegetation cover is high soils absorb less heat and so the depth of thaw is shallow •When vegetation cover is low, soils absorb more heat and thaw to a greater depth •The permafrost will dictate the future populations of animals via snow lie, via P in the soil, via the roots, via the vegetation Summary References • Beeby, A. & Brennan, A.M.
