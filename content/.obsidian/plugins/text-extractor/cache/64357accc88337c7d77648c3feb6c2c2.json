Relevant parts of: Chapter 27.1 (p 628 on) Chapter 28.1 (p 648 on) Chapter 40.3 (p 930 - 933 BR17520 Cell Biology Prof Huw D Jones hdj2@aber.ac.uk Morris et al. Chapter 28 (p 577 – 584) Chapter 10 (p 198 -200) Learning outcomes: • Concept, implications and evolution of multicellularity • That multicellular organisms are comprised of diverse cell types and their structure is adapted to their function. • Cells with a similar structure, function together as a tissue, that two or more tissues combine to form the various organs of the body, and these are further integrated into organ systems. • The structure and function of the skin as an example of a complex organ. Multicellularity and structural organisation Evolution of multicellularity Almost all prokaryotes are unicellular (a few from simple colonies but none form functionally differentiated tissues) Many eukaryotes show simple multicellularity (cell adhesion properties, simple co-operation but each cell retains unicellular functionality) Although they are very obvious in the environment, relatively few eukaryote classes (animals, plants/algae and fungi) have evolved complex multicellularity Complex multicellularity has evolved at least six separate times in different eukaryotic groups The vast majority of prokaryote organisms are unicellular: Shaped as spheres, rods or spirals but a few can from segmented filaments or colonies Key features of simple multicellular organisms: 1. Adjacent cells are stuck together via adhesion chemicals but there is little communication or transfer of resources between cells and little specialization. 2. Most or all of the cells retain a full range of functions including ability to reproduce 3. Every cell is in contact with the external environment so can exchange chemicals via diffusion.

Hepatocytes (liver cells) contain unusually large amounts of rough ER and mitochondria, needed for protein synthesis (eg. Plasma proteins including albumin and fibrinogen). Lázaro, Hernández-Machado & Pagonabarraga (2014). Rheology of red blood cells under flow in highly confined microchannels. Soft Matter, 2014, 10, 7195-7206 Long, multinucleated myocytes (muscle cells) have a striped appearance that reflect the alignment of actin and myosin filaments that are specialized for contraction. Slender extensions of the plasma membrane allow neurons to communicate with many other cells simultaneously. Cells in multicellular organisms become specialised to fulfil specific functions and their structure reflects that specialism, for example: Thin, comb-like projections, called microvilli, on intestinal epithelial cells increase their absorptive surface area. Cells in multicellular organisms become specialised to fulfil specific functions and their structure reflects that specialism, for example:Multicellular organisms possess different levels of organizational complexity: • Molecular/chemical • Cellular • Tissue • Organ • Organ system • Organism • cells exist in ‘communities’ that form tissues • organs possess different but functionally-integrated tissues • A range of tissues and organs work together in an organ system Examples of tissues in Human body A biological tissue is a collection of similar cells that work together to perform a specific function. See examples: Dermal tissue Eg. epidermis, guard cells Vascular tissue Eg xylem, phloem Meristematic tissues Eg. the growing tips in shoots, roots Examples of tissues in plants Ground tissues Eg. cortex, & pith of stems is composed of parenchyma cells Skin as an organ Also a key part of the integumentary system Several tissue types function together to form an organ Dermis Basal lamina Artery VeinSweat gland Nerve Epidermis Skin is also an organ! Examples of Organs Tissues and organs coordinate their functions to form ‘organ systems’ in mammals Structure and Function of Skin The skin is a community of cells. An example of an organ and a part of the integumentary system. D erm is Basal lamina Epidermis Basal / germinative layer Keratinocytes Melanocyte Artery VeinSweat gland Nerve Epidermis The skin has two main layers: a. The outer layer, the epidermis, serves as a water- resistant, protective barrier. b. The layer beneath the epidermis is the dermis. • Is made up of connective tissue (inc. collagen and elastin fibers). The main cell type found here is fibroblast, which synthesize the extracellular matrix and repair wounds. • Also contains hair follicles, sweat glands, nerve endings, touch receptors, fat deposits and blood vessels. Structure and Function of Skin The dermis layer: The tissues of the skin work together to maintain thermal homeostasis. Thermo-receptors in hypothalamus (in the brain) integrates information about body temperature from other thermo-receptors in skin etc. The hypothalamus uses autonomic nerve pathways to effect changes in muscles, sweat glands and blood vessels in the skin, to maintain a stable body temperature via negative feedback homeostasis. The skin plays a key role in thermal regulation of the body Homeostasis of body tempEffects of aging on skin • The sensitivity of the immune system is reduced. • Skin injuries and infections become more common & repairs proceed more slowly. • The skin becomes dry, less elastic and wrinkled. • Hair thins and changes colour. • The ability to lose heat decreases. As skin ages: • Fibroblasts secrete less collagen and elastin. Also secrete less of the enzymes that digest the old extracellular matrix • The epidermis becomes become less supportive, less elastic and more wrinkled https://www.today.com/slideshow/effects-smoking-sun-stress-skin-twins Jeanne Susan 1.Collagen is the most abundant animal protein on the planet. 2.There are more than 20 different forms of collagen, and it makes up over a quarter of the protein present in the body. 3.Over 90% of collagen is type I collagen, which is present in the dermis of human skin, where it provides support. 4.It is composed of intertwined fibers that make it stronger than if it were a single fiber of the same diameter. 5.It consists of three polypeptides wound around one another in a triple helix. What is collagen? Collagen molecules (triple helices) Collagen molecules are bundled like steel wires in a cable. Collagen fibrils Collagen fiber Collagen Many collagen /elastin creams and food products available but NO scientific evidence they work! The EU body that substantiates claims for health benefits is EFSA (the European Food Safety Authority). No applications have ever been made to EFSA for claims of TOPICALLY- APPLIED collagen for skin health. However it has judged on two applications for collagen as a FOOD SUPPLEMENT. In 2011 a company called Gelita AG, submitted an application for approval that ‘collagen hydrolysate maintains joint health’. In 2013 the same company submitted an application for approval that ‘VeriSol®P, maintains skin health, as indicated by an increased skin elasticity and a reduction of wrinkles volume’. ‘collagen hydrolysate maintained joint health’. EFSA did NOT approve the claim.‘VeriSol®P, maintains skin health, skin elasticity and a reduction of wrinkles volume’. EFSA did NOT approve the claim.
