Transcription, RNA processing and preparation for translation into proteins Learning outcomes: Understand: • DNA as the molecule carrying the genetic code • The mechanism of transcription • How raw (pre-) mRNA is processed by capping, poly-A tail and intron splicing. (ie. post transcriptional modifications) • How ‘alternative splicing’ undermines the ‘one gene one polypeptide’ idea Lecture ‘Amino Acids’ (Actually, transcription and preparing the mRNA for translation into proteins) Campbell et al. Chapter 16 (pages 364 -384) Morris et al. Chapter 3 (pages 49 -67) All cells contain the whole genome but not all genes are ‘active’ in all cell types or at all time points Regulatory elements control where and when each gene is expressed Promoter Genes possess regulatory elements: enhancers and promoters that interact with transcription factors to control where and when genes are ‘active’ https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Human_genome_by_functions.png region Enhancer Regulatory region Coding region Transcription Translation DNA mRNA Protein Ribosome The Central Dogma describes the process of ‘gene expression’ Cells can regulate gene expression at different stages These can be summarized into three types: Regulation Transcriptional, Regulation Post transcriptional/ translational Regulation Post translational Transcription of DNA into messenger RNA Template strand RNA transcript Nontemplate strand Terminator Promoter RNADNA Transcription is initiated at a promoter sequence (that possesses a TATA box) and ends at a terminator sequence. Which strand is transcribed can differ from one gene to the next. TATA TATA Initiation and Termination of Transcription RNA nucleotides are always synthesized in a 5'-to-3' direction by RNA polymerase. • For transcription to start, a complex of proteins must interact with each other and with the DNA to be ‘expressed’ • Individual transcription factors (TFs) bind to the promoter region of the gene • A mediator complex brings the RNA polymerase enzyme (RNA Pol II) into contact with the TFs and the DNA. • Up-stream enhancer regions on the DNA fold back and trigger the start of transcription • RNA Pol II transcribes DNA into RNA • Like DNA polymerases RNA Pol II adds new RNA nucleotides in the 5’ to 3’ direction Transcription needs several factors to work together General transcription factors bind to the promoter, and transcriptional activator proteins bind to enhancers. 1 Enhancer sequences Promoter Transcriptional start site 3' 5' 5' 3' 3' 5' 5' 3' Transcriptional activator proteins General transcription factors DNA Through looping of DNA, transcriptional activator proteins, mediator complex, RNA Pol II, and general transcription factors are brought into close proximity, allowing transcription to proceed. 2 Enhancer sequence Mediator complex Promoter RNA polymerase complex (Pol II) DNA Promoter region 3' 5' 3' 5' RNA Polymerase II Adds Nucleotides Template DNA strand RNA transcript RNA–DNA duplex RNA polymerase complex (Pol II) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsofH466lqk Watch the video (2 min 50 sec) below on transcription. Without needing to learn the names of specific factors that form the transcription complex appreciate: • That transcription starts at the TATA box and ends at a termination sequence in the DNA code • That many steps and different TFs that are needed to initiate gene transcription • That transcription requires energy in the form of ATP (a nucleoside triphosphate but not a component of DNA /RNA!) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MfSYnItYvg Watch this ‘3-D’ animation of transcription (1 min 52 sec). • See that contact between the transcription complex situated at the TATA box and up-stream enhancer sequences is the trigger for transcription to begin. • See that ‘free’ RNA nucleotides must be supplied to the RNA polymerase and are consumed in the process of transcription. The ‘raw’ mRNA is made in the nucleus It must be completed (processed) in the nucleolus before it can move to the cytoplasm for translation into protein. Processing involves adding a cap, a tail and the removal of introns (in that order) RNA processing enables nuclear export, stabilises the mRNA and aids recognition by translational ribosome complex mRNA Processing / post-transcriptional regulationWhat are introns? Non-coding sections of DNA in between exons Regulatory region of geneRegulatory region of gene ‘Coding’ region of gene plus Introns https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_gene_theory Intron Processed mRNA Pre-mRNA = raw mRNA = primary RNA transcript Eukaryotic Primary Transcript 5′ Cap on Eukaryotic mRNA 7-Methylguanosine 5'-to-5' phosphate linkage 5' end of RNA transcript The 5’ cap consists of a modified base linked by its 5’ carbon to the 5’ end of the primary transcript by a bridge composed of three phosphates. Raw mRNA 3’ end of the raw mRNA is trimmed and Poly-A tail added https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjWuVrzvZYA Watch the 2 min 31 sec video to understand: • That the 5’ end of the raw mRNA is capped with a methylated form of an RNA nucleotide triphosphate • That cleavage factors bind to the 3’ end of the mRNA using cleavage signals on the mRNA including AAUAAA as a guide • That a poly A polymerase enzyme trims the RNA and adds a series of adenosine mononucleotides (nucleotides with an adenine base) to form a polyA 3’ tail Poly(A) Tail on Eukaryotic mRNA Poly(A) tail 5' cap The 5' end is modified by a special nucleotide called the 5' cap. Polyadenylation adds a poly(A) tail to the 3' end. Eukaryotic cell DNA Primary transcript (RNA) Exon Intron mRNA Spliced exons The 5' end is modified by a special nucleotide called the 5' cap. 3’ end is trimmed and Poly A polymerase adds a poly(A) tail to the 3' end (polyadenylation) Introns are excised from the RNA and exons are spliced together. Intron splicing RNA Splicing Primary transcript Spliceosome components Exon Intron Splicing factors scan for intron/exon borders and cut out the intron. About 90% of all human genes contain at least one intron. The cleaved 5’ splice site is looped back to join the intron near the 3’ splice site forming a Lariat loop. Lariat quickly breaks down into individual nucleotides. Spliced exons are adjacent in the processed RNA. RNA Splicing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVgwr0QpYNE Watch this 1 min 37 sec video to understand how introns are spliced out of the raw mRNA by the spliceosome which re-joins the exons and leaves the unwanted intron in a Lariat loop Humans have less than 20,000 genes but can make over 100,000 proteins.

Ie. how the same pre-mRNA can give different mature RNAs and therefore different proteins Different types of cellular RNAs • mRNA - Messenger RNA: Transcribes the DNA code into the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide. • tRNA - Transfer RNA: Connects the genetic code to amino acid sequence in ribosomes during translation. • rRNA - Ribosomal RNA: With ribosomal proteins, makes up the structure of ribosomes, the organelles that translate the mRNA. • sRNA – Small RNAs: There are many classes of sRNAs that are involved in silencing viral replication, RNA processing in eukaryotes etc. Self-test questions on nucleic acids 1.
