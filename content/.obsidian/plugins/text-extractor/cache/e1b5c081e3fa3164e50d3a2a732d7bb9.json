Essential Cell Biology 4th edition, Garland Science or 5th edition, Norton Vesicle transport 2 Vesicle transport In this lecture we will… • Briefly describe principle of protein transport into organelles • Describe the different forms of exo- and endocytosis and what their function is • Gain a basic understanding of how specificity of transport is achieved • Gain basic understanding of some of the molecular mechanisms responsible for endocytosis 3 BR17520 Membrane enclosed organelles Contains many metabolic pathways; protein biosynthesis; the cytoskeleton Contains genome; DNA and RNA synthesis Synthesis of most lipids; synthesis of proteins for distribution to many organelles, the plasma membrane, and secreted proteins Modification, sorting, and packaging of proteins and lipids for either secretion or delivery to another organelle ATP synthesis by oxidative phosphorylation Oxidative breakdown of toxic molecules Sorting of endocytosed material Intracellular degradation 4 BR17520 Membrane enclosed organelles and protein transport Membrane-enclosed organelles import proteins by one of three mechanisms Pores function as selective gates that actively transport (GTP hydrolysis) specific macromolecules but also allow free diffusion of smaller molecules 5 BR17520 Fig 15-7 Essential Cell Biology, Fifth Edition Membrane enclosed organelles and protein transport Membrane-enclosed organelles import proteins by one of three mechanisms Pores function as selective gates that actively transport (GTP hydrolysis) specific macromolecules but also allow free diffusion of smaller molecules Involves receptors and protein translocators: the transported protein must unfold in order to snake through the translocators 6 BR17520 Membrane enclosed organelles and protein transport Signal sequences direct proteins to the correct compartment • A continuous stretch of amino acid sequence, typically 15-60 amino acids long • Often removed from the finished protein once it has been sorted • Both necessary and sufficient to direct a protein to a particular destination Membrane-enclosed organelles import proteins by one of three mechanisms 7 BR17520 Membrane enclosed organelles and protein transport Signal sequences direct proteins to the correct destination Membrane-enclosed organelles import proteins by one of three mechanisms 8 BR17520 Membrane enclosed organelles and protein transport Membrane-enclosed organelles import proteins by one of three mechanisms 9 BR17520 Pollen tube expressing GFP targeted to the mitochondria Membrane enclosed organelles and protein transport Pores function as selective gates that actively transport (GTP hydrolysis) specific macromolecules but also allow free diffusion of smaller molecules Involves receptors and protein translocators: the transported protein must unfold in order to snake through the translocators Fundamentally different process: transport vesicles pinch off from the membrane of one compartment and then fuse with the membrane of a second compartment Membrane-enclosed organelles import proteins by one of three mechanisms 10 BR17520 Vesicle transport  Transport vesicles carry soluble proteins, membrane, and transmembrane proteins between compartments.  Vesicular transport allows materials to exit or enter the cell. 11 BR17520 Vesicle transport Synthesis of cell-membrane components and materials to be secreted (e.g. glycosylated proteins and lipids) The membranes of the ER are continuous with the outer nuclear membrane Modifying, sorting and packaging of proteins for secretion. Transport of lipids around the cell. Creation of lysosomes. Glycosylation The extracellular space and each of the membrane-enclosed compartments (shaded gray) communicate with one another by means of transport vesicles, as shown. 12 BR17520 Vesicle transport Vesicle budding Vesicle docking 13 BR17520 Vesicle budding Vesicle budding is driven by the assembly of a protein coat Clathrin molecules form basketlike cages that help shape membranes into vesicles. (A) Electron micrographs showing the sequence of events in the formation of a clathrin-coated vesicle from a clathrin-coated pit. (B) Electron micrograph showing numerous clathrin- coated pits and vesicles budding from the inner surface of the plasma membrane 14 BR17520 Clathrin-coated vesicles transport selected cargo molecules  Clathrin-coated vesicles transport selected cargo molecules  Surface receptors ensure specificity of transport  Each vesicle starts off as a clathrin-coated pit; clathrin molecules assemble into a basketlike network on the cytosolic surface of the membrane  Wen budding from the plasma membrane this process is also called clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) 15 BR17520  Dynamin (GTP-binding protein) forms a ring around the neck of budding vesicles  GTP is hydrolysed to pinch off the vesicles  Adaptins secure the clathrin coat to the vesicle membrane  By binding to their specific cargo receptors, adaptins help in the capture of specific cargo molecules Clathrin-coated vesicles transport selected cargo molecules 16 BR17520 Clathrin-coated vesicles transport selected cargo molecules  Clathrin molecules form basketlike cages that help shape membranes into vesicles  Clathrin-coated vesicles bud from both the Golgi apparatus and from the plasma membrane 17 BR17520 Vesicle transport Synthesis of cell-membrane components and materials to be secreted (e.g. glycosylated proteins and lipids) The membranes of the ER are continuous with the outer nuclear membrane Modifying, sorting and packaging of proteins for secretion. Transport of lipids around the cell. Creation of lysosomes. Glycosylation How is specificity of vesicular transport achieved? The extracellular space and each of the membrane-enclosed compartments (shaded gray) communicate with one another by means of transport vesicles, as shown. 18 BR17520 Vesicle docking depends on Tethers and SNAREs  Rab GTPases, a diverse family of molecular markers on the surface identify the vesicle according to origin and cargo  Rab GTPases are recognized by receptors (tethering proteins) on the cytosolic surface of the target membrane  Coding system of matching Rab and tethering proteins  SNARES provide additional recognition: v-SNARES interact with complementary t-SNARES, firmly docking the vesicle in place 19 BR17520 SNARE proteins catalyse the fusion of the two membranes  SNAREs catalyse the membrane fusion process (2 lipid bilayers), which is energetically unfavourable to prevent membranes from fusing randomly  The pairs of v-SNAREs and T-SNAREs act like a winch that pulls the two lipid bilayers into close proximity (squeezing out any water molecules trapped between the two membranes). 20 BR17520 N Vesicle transport: Exocytosis Exocytosis is the process of vesicles fusing with the plasma membrane, releasing or “secreting” their contents Since glycosylation only occurs in the ER lumen… …glycosylated domains always end up outside of the cell Images:Becker et al. The World of the Cell, 6th Ed., Pearson;; Exocytosis does not always take place at every surface. This figure shows polarised transport 21 BR17520 Example of polarized secretion of secretory vesicles Pollen tubes deliver sperm cells to the egg cell in the embryo sac of the pistil. Polarized delivery of secretory vesicles to the apex is crucial for “polarized tip-growth” 22 BR17520 Example of polarized secretion of secretory vesicles Pollen tubes deliver sperm cells to the egg cell in the embryo sac of the pistil. Polarized delivery of secretory vesicles to the apex is crucial for “polarized tip-growth” 23 BR17520 Two exocytosis pathways: constitutive and regulated Supplies the plasma membrane with new lipids and proteins. Protein secretion: some remaining attached to cell surface, some incorporated into ECM, others diffuse to nourish or signal other cells Operates in cells specialised for secretion. Large quantities of a particular product (e.g. hormone, mucus, or digestive enzymes) produced and stored in secretory vesicles 24 BR17520 Example of regulated exocytosis pathway Secretory vesicles store insulin in a pancreatic β cell. Insulin is released into the extracellular space in response to an increase in glucose levels in the blood. Insulin is stored in highly concentrated aggregated form. After secretion the insulin aggregates dissolve rapidly in the blood 25 BR17520 Vesicle transport: Endocytosis Important to note that both exocytosis and endocytosis affect the surface area of the cell (by adding and removing membrane) : The opposite of exocytosis https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocytosis 26 BR17520 Phagocytosis (“cellular eating”) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocytosis  Most dramatic form of endocytosis  In protozoa (unicellular organisms), phagocytosis is a form of feeding. Phagosomes fuse with lysosomes, where the food particles are digested  In animals, phagocytosis is important for defence and scavenging dead and damaged cells  Phagocytosis performed by phagocytes which include many types of white blood cells (e.g. neutrophils, macrophages etc.)  Recognition process which leads to the protrusion (pseudopods) of the membrane (involving the action of the cytoskeleton) which then engulfs the particle  For instance, a particle (e.g. bacteria) that induces an immune response (leading to the coating of bacteria with antibodies) is bound by the phagocyte and recognized by specific receptors on its surface. The phagosome fuses with the lysosome and the microbe is destroyed by hydrolytic enzymes 27 BR17520 Phagocytosis (“cellular eating”) 28 BR17520 Pinocytosis (“cellular drinking”) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocytosis  Is performed by most cells and occurs continuously  This process of cellular drinking is not molecule specific  Relatively small quantities of extracellular fluid, containing salts, water, amino acids etc. is taken up  Whatever happens to be around the invaginating region will end up being engulfed into the cell 29 BR17520 Intestinal microvilli  absorption of nutrients Receptor mediated endocytosis (RME) 30 Also called clathrin- mediated endocytosis (CME) RME provides a selective concentrating mechanism that increases the efficiency of internalization of particular macromolecules >1000 fold compared with pinocytosis BR17520 Receptor mediated endocytosis (RME) 31  Cells need to take up cholesterol to make new membrane  It is extremely water insoluble  Cholesterol bound to low-density lipoproteins (LDL)  LDL-cholesterol bind to receptors  RME  Naked vesicle fuses with the endosome  Acidic environment triggers dissociation of LDL with its receptor LDL enters cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. BR17520 Lysosomes: intracellular digestion Principle sites of intracellular digestion Like the endosomes, the lumen is acidic Contain about 40 types of hydrolytic enzymes All are optimally active at pH~5 How is the acidic pH of the lysosome maintained? 32 BR17520 Lysosomes: intracellular digestion 33 BR17520 Figure 15–37 Materials destined for degradation in lysosomes follow different pathways to the lysosome.
