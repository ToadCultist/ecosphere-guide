KINGDOM: ANIMALIA Protostomia • This taxon comprises of protostomes that undergo spiral cleavage. • Not a true ranked taxon. • Includes: Mollusca, Annelida, Platyhelmintes etc. KINGDOM: ANIMALIA Spiralia Protostomes • During development the coelom is formed through schizocoely. • Includes including Annelida, Arthropoda, Mollusca etc. • Undergo spiral cleavage and their development is determinate or mosaic. Triploblastic (Eubilateria) Inverts. • Triploblastic: endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm.  Acoelomate: lack a coelomic cavity.  Pseudocoelomate or blastocoelomate: lack a true coelomic cavity.  Coelomate or eucoelomate: have a coelomic cavity. • A coelom (see-lem: Gk. koîlos hollow cavity) is an internal fluid filled cavity bounded on both sides with embryonic mesoderm. Triploblastic (Eubilateria) Inverts. Acoelomate Pseudocoelomate Coelomate Endoderm Mesoderm Ectoderm Body cavity Gut Acoelomate Phyla • Triploblastic: endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm.  Acoelomate: lack a coelomic cavity. • Includes Platyhelminthes, Rhombozoa, Gastrotricha, Nematomorpha etc. Phylum Platyhelminthes • Considered to be the basal phylum of the taxon Eubilateria. • 6,500 spp. free living, 12,000 flukes and 8,000 tapeworms. • No true defining synapomorphies. • Triploblastic, acoelomate, complex (incomplete) gut, CNS and “brain”, protonephridia, parenchyma, simultaneous hermaphrodites etc. Pseudocoelomate Phyla • Triploblastic: endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm.  Pseudocoelomate: lack a true coelomic cavity. • Includes Rotifera, Nematoda, Priapula etc. Coelomate Phyla • Triploblastic: endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm.  Coelomate: have a true coelomic cavity. • Includes the vast majority of the Eubilateria, including Annelida, Arthropoda, Mollusca, Chordata etc. • This taxon comprises of those phyla that produce a larva type called a trochophore: Trochozoa… AND…. …those that posses a lophophore: Lophophorata. • Together they form the grouping: Lophotrochozoa!

Prostomium Trunk: metameric segmentation Peristomium Pygidium Phylum Annelida • Characteristics: bilaterally symmetrical, segmented, spiral cleavage, through gut with specialisation, metanepridia, nervous system, chaetae, closed circulatory system etc. Diagram of a post-clitellum segment from a typical oligochaete worm showing its various body systems and organs. Based on the author's comparison and interpretation of several zoology images, including the following: [1], [2], [3] and [4]. Images of the nephrostome were derived from here. Phylum MolluscaPhylum Mollusca • L. mollis – soft. 80,000 species. • Includes snails, cephalopods, bivalves, chitons, sea slugs, tusk shells etc. • Characteristics: bilaterally symmetrical, open circulatory system (haeocoel), mantle, mantle cavity, complex through gut, radula, complex metanephridia, visceral mass etc. Phylum Mollusca • Phylum Mollusca contains 8 classes:  Class Caudofoveata – spicule “worms”.  Class Solenogastres – spicule “worms”.  Class Monoplacophora – deep sea shelled molluscs.  Class Polyplacophora – chitons.  Class Gastropoda – snails and slugs etc.  Class Bivalvia – mussels, cockles etc.  Class Scaphopoda – tusk shells etc.  Class Cephalopoda – squid, cuttlefish, octopuses etc. Class Gastropoda • The visceral mass contains all the major organs. • One large muscular foot. • Single (typically) clockwise coiled shell: dextral. • Columellar muscle. • Torsion. • 3 recognised groups: prosobranchs, opisthobranchs and pulmonates. Class Gastropoda • Radula – toothed tongue used for feeding. • Secreted from the radula sac. • Supported by a muscular odontophore • Can be modified into a harpoon or drill etc. • Strongest biological material (Barber, Lu & Pugno, 2017)! • This taxon comprises of those phyla that moult their cuticle at least once. • Other characteristics: three layered cuticle, lack cilia, protostomes but do not undergo spiral cleavage and regulate moulting through the production of ecdysteroids (hormones). • Includes: Nematoda, Tardigrada, Onychophora, Arthropoda etc. KINGDOM: ANIMALIA Ecdysozoa Phylum ArthropdaPhylum Arthropoda • Gk. árthron – joint and podos – leg. • 75% of all animals are arthropods! • 1,000,000+ species! • Characteristics: segmented body (tagmatization) with pair of jointed legs, exoskeleton, open circulatory system, complex gut with specialisation, growth through moulting, compound eyes etc. Phylum Arthropoda • Exoskeleton secreted by the underlying epidermis. • Epicuticle: lipoprotein layer. • Procuticle: chitin. Phylum Arthropoda • Phylum Arthropoda contains 4 subphyla:  Subphylum Crustacea – crabs, lobsters, shrimps etc.  Class Branchiopoda.  Class Malacostraca – true crabs.  Class Thecostraca – barnacles.  Class Copepoda – copepods.  Class Ostracoda – ostracods…..etc.  Subphylum Hexapoda.  Class Insecta – insects. Phylum Arthropoda • Phylum Arthropoda contains 4 subphyla:  Subphylum Myriapoda.  Class Chilopoda - centipedes.  Class Diplopoda – millipedes…..  Subphylum Chelicerata.  Class Pycnogonida – sea spiders.  Class Euchelicerata  Subclass Merostomata – horse shoe crabs.  Subclass Arachnida – true spiders….etc. Phylum Arthropoda Class Insecta • Body divided into: head, thorax and abdomen. • Wings (if present) on mesothorax and metathorax – pterothorax. • Halteres. • Tympanal organs. • Tracheal system. • Malpighian tubules. Phylum Arthropoda Class Crustacea • Head and thorax fused (cephalothorax) and covered with a calcified carapace. • Two pairs of antennae. • Produce nauplii larvae. • Rostrum.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
