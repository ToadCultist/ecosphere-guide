Brown rot (BR) evolved secondarily several times Saprotrophs ‘sapros’ = putrefying Colonise and degrade dead material Nectrotrophs ‘necros’ = dead Coloniser living host and kills it Biotrophs Colonise living host BUT does not cause host death Living Host Tissues ‘Litter’ Humus BIOTROPHY NECROTROPHY SAPROTROPHY Biotrophs Colonise living host BUT does not cause host death Nectrotrophs ‘necros’ = dead Coloniser living host and kills it Saprotrophs ‘sapros’ = putrefying Colonise and degrade dead material Candida albicans (candidiasis) Aspergillus fumigatus (Aspergillosis) Penicillium marneffii (East Asia) Small spores (2-3um) access via lung Not many systemic diseases of humans (few fungi can grow well at 37C). Once established, therapy is difficult. Mostly infect immunosuppressed patients. Fungi can’t take the heat Why are we 37C? Metarhizium acridum, locust-specific pathogen. Used for biocontrol of locust swarms Infected locusts sunbathe to inhibit pathogen spread (‘behavioural fever’) Metarhizium acridum grows optimally at 28C. Stops growing at 42C. healthy locust Athlete’s Foot (Tinea pedis) Epidermophyton floccosum White-nose syndrome caused by Geomyces destructans (psychrophile so infects during hibernation) Few fungi thrive at 37C Inhalation of fungal allergens Antigens on the surface of inhaled spores may exacerbate allergies Repair of the gut mucosa is promoted by bacterial metabolites but gut yeasts can disrupt this process Deoxycholate from Akkermansia muciniphila aids would healing. But antibiotic treatment causes dysbiosis and proliferation of yeasts which disrupt mucosal repair and may be one of the causes of Crohn’s disease. Jain et al.(2021). Debaryomyces is enriched in Crohn’s disease intestinal tissue and impairs healing in mice. Science 371, 1154–1159 (DOI: 10.1126/science.abd0919) In this case, the yeast is not strictly a pathogen but exacerbates pre- existing tissue damage (other yeasts do not have a similar effect) mucosal lesions DUTCH ELM DISEASE Ophiosotma ulmi (Ascomycete) Necrotrophic vascular wilt pathogen 1920’s and 1970’s epidemics (from USA in diseased logs) Bark beetle vector (Scolytus) Disease control 1. Breeding 2. Sanitation None effective 3. Fungicides Ophiostoma ulmi life cycle Bark beetle vector Scolytus scolytus Vascular discoloration Wilting symptoms Unilateral infection DED infection Yeast-Mycelial Dimorphism Sticky fungal spores on walls of beetle galleries LATE BLIGHT of potato and tomato Phytophthora infestans (Oomycete, \"Fungus-like organism\") Evolved in central America. Arrived in USA 1843 and Europe 1845 Late blight disease -potato and tomato LATE BLIGHT Phytophthora infestans (Oomycete, Pseudofungus) Infects potato, tomato (+relatives) EPIDEMIOLOGY Needs cool, wet weather (10-24C, RH > 75% for 48 hr) Smith / Beaumont period  Blight outbreak Disease lesions apparent 2-3 wks later ‘Blight’ years (1st occurs June to August) 75% foliage loss  end of tuber growth Zoospore Release + penetration Night-time sporulation Airborne dispersal Dewdrop Cold water Dispersal of late blight P.infestans sporangia on leaf surface Biflagellate zoospores Zoospores on encyst on leaf surface and lose flagella Zoospore release from sporangium Late blight Infection process Hemibiotroph “Lunar Module” Sexual oospores require presence of A1 + A2 mating types A2 mating type only reached Europe in 1970’s after potato shipments from Mexico. So from 1845 to 1970s only A1 mating type existed in Europe/US LATE BLIGHT DISEASE CONTROL 1. Breeding (resistant cultivars) 2. Sanitation (remove inoculum - eg. Diseased tubers) 3. Fungicides (resistance problems) Blitecast  computer prediction Copper vs. phenylamide fungicides Aim is to slow down disease progress Resistance screening Detached leaf assay First pesticide Bordeaux mixture (CuSO4 + Lime) Effective against Oomycetes but NOT true Fungi Biotrophic pathogens Rusts / Smuts / Powdery mildews Form appressoria to infect + feeding haustoria Highly evolved - do not kill host Stem rust (Puccinia graminis) on cereal crops Heteroecious (= two hosts) Barberry and grasses Three spore types!! race Ug99 (Uganda 99) now spreading across Africa/Asia In 17-19th C, removal of alternate host (barberry) inhibited sexual cycle • Coffee Rust is caused by Hemileia vastatrix • 1st discovered in Kenya (1861) but spread to Asia • From 1869-1890 Sri Lanka coffee exports dropped by>95% as farmers switched to tea That’s why tea is drunk in the UK. Plant Diseases: Coffee RustPowdery mildews (obligate biotrophs)Resistance screening of barley varieties to powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis var hordei) Cereal Powdery Mildew (Blumeria spp.) Very specific host range Wheat - B. graminis var. tritici Barley - B. graminis var. hordei Blumeria spores sense host surface within minutes of landing Host must detect fungus quickly.
