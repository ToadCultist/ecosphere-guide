Selecting the right test 2.1 Types of data & graphing 2.2 Parametric statistical assumptions Dr Roger Santer, rds5@aber.ac.uk You now understand the statistical hypothesis testing framework • Null hypothesis (H0) • Alternate hypothesis (HA) • P value • Reject H0 if p<0.05 Statistical tests are tools that do hypothesis testing. But we need the right tool for the right job, and we need to operate it correctly. Making assumptions… 2.1 Types of data, & graphing Imagine we went pond dipping and caught some sticklebacks. What data could we record from them? There are different types of data In an analysis, we have independent and dependent variables • Knowing which is which, and what form they take, tells us how to graph the data • Independent variable = ‘the cause’ (belongs on the x-axis) • Dependent variable = ‘the effect’ (belongs on the y axis) • Understanding how the data are graphed will help us select the right statistical tool Back to the sticklebacks… • In the following, what kind of data do we have? Which is the independent and dependent variable? What kind of graph should we plot? – We have data on sex (m/f) and body length (mm)… – We have data on body length (mm) and swimming speed (m/s)… Knowing how we graph the data helps us understand the statistical problem, so always start by visualising your data! 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Independent (n=30) Cooperative (n=30)% of correct choices (mean ± SEM) Breed type Bar graph = we need a statistical test of difference between 2 or more groups Scatter graph = we need a statistical test of relationship between variables Lecture attendance (%) This module will not teach you how to graph data, but it will provide self- guided resources to help you do so 2.2 Assumptions of parametric statistical methods There are different types of data In the first part of the course we will concentrate on methods for analysing these Imagine we measured body length for our sticklebacks and plotted a histogram… 98765 Body length (cm)Number of fish Histogram of stickleback body length The normal distribution Many (but not all) continuous variables conform to a normal distribution The normal distribution is defined by its mean value (µ) and its standard deviation (σ) 68.2% of observations are within µ ± 1 σ 95.5% of observations are within µ ± 2 σ By M.
