Close range/contact chemoreception • Olfaction = ‘smell’. Long range chemoreception • Tastant = the chemical stimulus that activates a taste sensation • Odorant = the chemical stimulus that activates an olfactory sensation Gustation in vertebrates Comparative stats: 9,000 taste buds in human oral cavity and throat 15,000 in rabbits 550 in lizards 24 in chickens! >100,000 in catfish, covering body surface! Gustation in vertebrates Taste buds Receptor cells (~10 day turnover) Microvilli project into taste pore Five distinct primary tastes Basal cells generate receptor cells ‘Salt’ and ‘Sour’ tastants interact directly with ion channels The receptors for ‘sweet’, ‘bitter’ and ‘umami’ activate G proteins and influence ion channels via second messengers 游 焰熾 ; https://www.flickr.com/photos/97668319@N03/ Public domain. Unlike many mammals, cats (Felis silvestris catus) do not prefer sweet foods. The sweet taste receptor in most mammals is a heteromer resulting from the expression of two different genes: Tas1r2 and Tas1r3. In cat, tiger, and cheetah, Tas1r3 is functional and expressed, but Tas1r2 is not functional and is not expressed (a ‘pseudogene’). Therefore, cats appear not to have a functional sweet receptor, explaining their behaviour. Li et al., 2005 Olfaction in vertebrates Purves D, Augustine GJ, Fitzpatrick D, et al. (2001). Neuroscience, 2nd ed., Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK11039/ Olfactory transduction cascade Olfactory transduction involves odorant receptor proteins embedded in membrane. In contrast to gustation, there are a huge number of odorant receptor protein types (>1000 in mammals). The transduction cascade involves a G protein and second messenger.
