MEIOSIS is the reduction division of the nucleus in which the zygotic/somatic number of chromosomes (2n) is reduced to the gametic number (n). In MITOSIS each phase of chromatid formation is associated with a nuclear division. In MEIOSIS one chromosome replication is followed by two successive nuclear divisions, meiosis I and meiosis II, giving a reduced chromosome number. Consider the situation for one pair of chromosomes: MITOSIS MEIOSIS I MEIOSIS II anaphase metaphase Meiosis Fertilisation Meiosis is part of the sexual cycle of reproduction n 2n Zygotic/somatic cell Gametic cell Diagrammatic representation of the main visible events of meiosis in an organism with 2 pairs of chromosomes 1.

Telophase II *CHIASMA = the cross-shaped arrangement of non-sister chromatids at the point of exchange between homologous chromosomes which occurs during crossing over (aka recombination). Prophase I Meiosis in Sordaria brevicollisPerithecia • the products of every meiosis can be observed directly and are maintained in a linear order. • Mutants are available, which allow us to monitor the segregation of gene • We used two mutants which have different coloured ascospores + x Ab or + x S27 Non-rec Rec Gene can be mapped relative to the centromere simply by scoring the relative frequency of recombinant asci Mapping S27 and Ab Gene x Gene x How do we map the gene? • No crossover between gene and centromere = non-recombinant • Crossover between gene and centromere = recombinant • The number of recombinant asci is directly related to the number of crossovers formed between the centromere and the gene being mapped • Frequency of crossing over is dependent upon distance Recombinant = 8 Non-recombinant = 2 How are we going to do this?
