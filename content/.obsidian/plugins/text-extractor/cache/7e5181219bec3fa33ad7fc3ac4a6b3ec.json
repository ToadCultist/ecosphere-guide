Poor fossil record -but estimate for the divergence of the phyla range from 600-1200 MYA Linked to the 2nd GOE (Great Oxygenation Event) 500-1000 MYA Proliferation of higher fungi after plant colonisation of land Why fungi are useful in biotechnology Fungi are mainly found in terrestrial systems where they are the primary agents of decomposition (Without fungi leaves and other detritus would not rot and global nutrient cycling would grind to a halt). Fungi secrete a wide variety of extracellular enzymes and can produce diverse complex organic compounds through secondary metabolic processes Biotechnology = Manipulation of biological systems for human benefit (so includes traditional foods, medicine etc.) but usually refers to more high tech processes BASIDIOMYCETES ASCOMYCETES ZYGOMYCETES CHYTRIDIOMYCETES (e.g. Mucor - Pin Mould / Tempe) (e.g. Neocallimastix ) Mushrooms, Toadstools (e.g. Agaricus bisporus ) Bread mould ( Penicillium ), Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) Kingdom FUNGI Fungi and FLOs (Fungus-Like Organisms)Genetic variation among single basidiospore isolates Parent dikaryon 2 nulcei/cell (+clamps) Progeny monokaryon 1 nucleus/cell (no clamps) Convergent Evolution Oomycetes Mycelium Cellulose CW Aseptate hyphae Chytridiomycetes Thallus Chitin CW Rhizoids Zoosporic Fungi Not fully terrestrial -require water at some stage of life cycle 15-20MYa -Dominica Amber Aureofungus yaniguensis -only 4th known agaric fossil How ancient are the Fungi?
