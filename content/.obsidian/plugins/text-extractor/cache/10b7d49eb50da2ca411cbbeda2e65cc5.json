Suppose it’s Na+… If more Na+ enters the cell, what does that do to the membrane potential? K+ K+ When the right chemical stimulus occurs, the ligand-gated channel opens Graded potentials If the ICF becomes more positive We call this depolarisation The more ‘stimulus’... The more ion channels open, The greater the potential =graded What if the ion channel was selective for K+? Graded Potentials decrease in amplitude with distance The space constant • Axons are dendrites are narrow, and their cytoplasm is a relatively poor conductor • The cell membrane is a relatively poor insulator • Therefore, voltage signals get smaller as they passively conduct • A measurement of this property is the space constant Image: Simmons & Young (2010). Nerve Cells and Animal Behaviour. Cambridge University Press. Some neurons only use graded potentials • Second order L-neurons of the locust ocellus bring information about changes in light intensity to the brain • They are large, have relatively long space constants, and only have to transmit signals a relatively short distance Long axons! • Lots of the time, neurons have to carry their signals long distances • E.g. sciatic nerve Signals in the nervous system: electrical potentials • Signals in neurons • Graded potentials • Action potentials Action potentials Cell body Dendrites axon synapse Axon terminals Axon hillock Begin at the axon hillock Carry signals a long distance down axon Depend on voltage-gated ion channels Action potentials All-or-nothing events Membrane potential swings rapidly positive (depolarisation) Then rapidly negative (repolarisation) Next, refractory period An important model system: the giant axons of squid Control the squid’s escape response Huge axons… ~1mm diameter! Hodgkin & Huxley (1939) observed that Vm reverses sign during an AP, approaching ENa+ This indicates that Vm has not just collapsed to zero, and with other experimental evidence, implicates Na+ movements in producing the AP. Action potential: depolarisation Voltage-gated Na+ channels Threshold = –55mV Activated by graded potential of sufficient size What happens to Na+? And Vm? ~+30mV (then Na+ channels inactivate) Action potential: repolarisation Voltage-gated K+ channels Also opened by graded potential, but with a delay K+ diffuses out of the cell What happens to Vm? Refractory period Absolute refractory period Na+ channels inactivated Relative refractory period K+ channels still open Action potentials propagate along the axon An action potential occurs in one section of axon. This triggers a new action potential at neighbouring location Maximising conduction speed (1): large diameter axons The greater the diameter of an axon, the less its internal resistance and greater its space constant. This means that the current spreads further, triggering next AP at greater distance In many animals, escape pathways involve very large neurons Maximising conduction speed (2): myelination Myelin provides insulation = no ion movement, except at nodes ‘Saltatory conduction’ Myelination Ion channels at nodes only, and insulation (myelin) between, means circuits of local current flow depolarise next node at distance greater than possible in un-insulated axon Not only faster, but also more efficient – less ion movements overall Sherwood et al (2005) Animal physiology: from genes to organisms.
