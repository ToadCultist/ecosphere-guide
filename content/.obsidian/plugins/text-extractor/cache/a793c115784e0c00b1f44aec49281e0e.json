Acetylcholine-esterase breaks down ACh... Recycling! Synapses and Integration • Electrical synapses • Chemical synapses • Temporal & spatial summation Recall some concepts from lecture 2 • Graded potentials conduct passively through dendrites and cell body • The size of the signal at the axon hillock determines whether V-gated ion channels are opened, and an action potential occurs Graded potentials can sum in time = temporal summation • If action potentials occur frequently enough in the pre-synaptic cell, graded potentials in the postsynaptic cell overlap Temporal summation in a locust neuronSanter et al. (2006). Journal of Neurophysiology. • A single post-synaptic neuron receives synapses from many pre-synaptic neurons, but in different parts of its dendritic arbor • If these all elicit EPSPs, they can sum together as they propagate Graded potentials can sum in space = spatial summation Summation allows neurons to make decisions! 26 McClean AD (2012).
