{"path":"University/Lecture slides/Microbial and plant diversity/Flowering.pdf","text":"BR19920 Molecular controls of flowering Dr Dylan Phillips (dwp@aber.ac.uk) Objectives By end of lecture, you should understand: • ‘Floral induction’ in leaf • Floral regulator genes in apex Brief ‘night break’ light  long day Photoperiodic control of floweringBlack cloth → induce flowers in short-day plants Chrysanthemum - short-day plant indigenous to China Chailakhyan (1937)  flowering stimulus in Chrysanthemum leaves Leaves in short days Apex in long days  Apex in short days Leaves in long days Chailakhyan (1937)  flowering stimulus must be mobile Leaves Apex • Mobile signals = ‘hormones’ • Chailakhyan called unknown flowering hormone ‘florigen’ • Identification took 70 years ? Asteraceae Hamner (1942)  flowering stimulus in ‘cocklebur’ leaves (short-day plant) • One shoot in short days → both flowering Hamner (1942)  flowering stimulus in ‘cocklebur’ plants with two shoots • Shoot in short days has only 1/8 leaf → both flowering • Shoot in short days has only no leaves → neither flowering Lamiaceae Zeevaart (1965)  flowering stimulus in Perilla frutescens leaves (short-day plant) • Single leaf from plant in short days • Repeatedly grafted on plants in long days → induces flowering Zeevaart (1965)  flowering stimulus in Perilla frutescens leaves (short-day plant) • Single leaf from plant in long days → no flowering • Leaves • Apex ‘Florigen’ moves from leaf to apex - how? • ‘Photoassimilates’ (organic products of CO2 fixation) move leaf → apex in ‘phloem’ transport system • Phloem transport rate: 50-100 cm h-1 Takeba & Takimoto (1966)  rate of ‘florigen’ movement in ‘Japanese morning glory’ • Ipomoea nil: Japanese floricultural plant since 8th century • Culturally important to Japan • Japanese published genome in 2016 Takeba & Takimoto (1966)  rate of ‘florigen’ movement in ‘Japanese morning glory’ • ‘Donor leaves’ → floral stimulus in last 2 h of 16 h dark period  ‘Florigen’ moved 102 cm in 2 h  ~50 cm h-1  phloem transport? 102 cm Receptor bud • Cut off donor leaves @ 16 h dark → ‘receptor bud’ still flowers Is ‘florigen’ the same substance in short-day and long- day plants? Photoperiodic control of flowering Is ‘florigen’ the same substance in short-day and long- day plants? Zeevaart (1982)  grafting of related species Crassulaceae • Kalanchoë blossfeldiana → short-day plant (SDP) • Sedum spectabile → long-day plant (LDP) • Echeveria harmsii → SLDP (need short then long days to flower) • Bryophyllum crenatum & Kalanchoë daigremontianum → LSDP (need long then short days to flower) • ‘Florigen’ from stock → scion flowers • Same signal in LD & SD plants Stock → inductive photoperiod Scion → non- inductive photoperiod ‘Florigen’ transmission between flowering types LDP SDP ✓ SLDP LDP ✓ ✓ ✓ LDP LSDP SLDP LSDP Flowering mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana • ‘Facultative’ long-day flowering (long days promote rather than essential for flowering) • Koornneef (1991)  late flowering in single-gene mutants • Molecular genetics (1995-1999)  key genes for floral signalling isolated Mutants in FT gene flower later in long days ‘Florigen’ is a protein • Day-length sensor in leaves → ‘FT protein’ • FT moves to buds & induces floral regulator genes CONSTANS (CO) • CO – nuclear zinc finger transcription factor • Expressed in leaves • Response to long days activates the transcription of FT Henderson, I. R., & Dean, C. (2004). The Circadian Clock • All organisms perceive the day and night cycles. • To adapt and prepare for these cycles, a mechanism based on genetic feedback loops has been developed. • The circadian clock in plants affects many processes on a genetic level. Input Oscillator Output The Circadian Clock Singh & Mas (2018) ‘CO’ protein ‘FT’ mRNA CO protein degraded in dark FT protein = floral stimulus CO protein stabilized by phytochrome signal CO induces FT gene Flowering gene ‘Constans (CO)’ → photoperiodic control Day-length sensor in leaves → ‘FT protein’ NB short-day plants like rice have extra controls Virus-induced flowering • ‘Disarmed’ virus engineered to express FT • Infect crop with virus → virus & FT in phloem → flowering • FT moves to buds & induces floral regulator genes • Day-length sensor in leaves → ‘FT protein’ ‘Florigen’ is a proteinFloral regulator genes discovered as mutants • ‘LEAFY’ (gene symbol ‘LFY’) → master regulator of floral genes • Mutant ‘lfy’ flowers have leaf-like organs instead of petals, stamens or carpels Floral regulator genes in transgenic experiments • p35S:LFY flowers at ‘rosette’ stage without inflorescence stem • ‘p35S:LFY’ = wild-type LFY transgene expressed from constitutive promoter (always on)LFY ‘homologues’ in other species Floral regulators are transcription factors • Transcription factors (TFs) → proteins that bind to DNA ‘promoter’ sequences to activate or repress transcription of genes DNA-binding region of LFY protein dimer Floral organ identity is controlled by multiple feedback loops Class E genes - identified SEPALLATA genes (SEP1-4) function with the other homeotic genes in specifying floral organs Many floral regulator genes • Flower mutants reveal TFs controlling the four ‘whorls’ of floral organs: • Sepals • Petals • Stamens • Carpels Summary • Photoperiod sensed in leaves not buds • History of evidence for mobile ‘florigen’ • Identification of ‘FT protein’ from Arabidopsis mutants • FT protein from leaves induces floral regulator genes in buds • Multiple transcription factors control flower formation Image acknowledgments Campbell & Reece (2008) Biology, 8th edn.
