Mycelial cords 2. Rhizomorphs 3. Sclerotia 4. Fruit bodies (mushrooms etc.) Multi-hyphal Structures = FUNGAL DIFFERENTIATION Mycelial cords Single apical hypha Aggregated hyphae (<5mm diam) 1. Forgaging for nutrients 2. Translocation of water & nutrients Very similar patterns to Ant foraging New food source Foraging cords Cords translocate nutrients into woodblock Further foraging Exploitation Of new food 1 2 3 4 14C / 32P radiotracers Dry Rot (Serpula lacrymans) Roof Damage (=water ingress) Mycelial Cords - Explore non- nutrient zones Grow through plaster/bricks Translocation of water to dry wood Liquid is exuded from tip of cord 1cm Liquid droplets ‘Root -like’ structure (with a meristem) High Growth Rate (5x greater than hyphal growth) Rhizomorphs Eg. Honey Fungus, Tropical Litter Trappers Melanised rind Cortex Lumen Mucilage Honey fungus (Armillaria mellea) Rhizomorphs used to attack healthy trees Mycelial survival structures Sclerotia Claviceps spp.- ergot alkaloid (infects many grasses) Sclerotium spp. - germinate in response to host exudates cf. rhizomorphs - (dispersal in time vs. space) 1mm - 1cm Melanised Rind Cortex Long-term survival in soil Claviceps purpurea (Ergot) caused St. Anthony’s Fire in medieval times (convulsion/gangrene/hallucination) contains Ergotamine (alkaloid related to LSD) Ergometrine now used to treat bleeding during childbirth Blamed for Salem witch trials (1692) 1. Spore Type (sexual/asexual etc.) 2. Environmental cues(light/CO2 etc.) 3. Developmental Biology 4. Discharge / dispersal (Active/passive/assisted) 5. Dormancy / germination Fungal SporulationDORMANCY Exogenous Response to external nutrients Host metabolites Endogenous Self-inhibition eg. post-Fire fungi (Neurospora - 20min@60C) needed before germination When spores do not germinate immediately Neurospora sporulating on heated sugar cane waste Right SPORE Right PLACE Right Time Fungal Sporulation Mushrooms coincide with leaf fall (new supply of food) No food left - time to move on! Spores -usually <10 µm  low inoculum potential Respond to:- LIGHT MOISTURE LOW NUTRIENTS GASEOUS ENV DUNG FUNGI Gravi- tropism Phototropism TROPISMS Animals don’t feed near their own dung, so spores must be projected onto fresh vegetation LIGHT Pilobolous (dung fungus) Pilobolus Phototropism Increased CW growth on this side LIGHT Phycomyces mutant Fruiting induced by :- Peat Casing (=low nutrients) Low CO2 Reduced temp / humidity Light NOT required Cultivated mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) Several flushes at weekly intervals (unlike Oysters, Phycomyces) Cultivated Mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) Fruiting induced peat casing layer (low nutrients) and opening (reduces CO2 and humidity). Fruiting occurs in several 'flushes'. TAKE-OFF  ‘FLIGHT’  LANDING DISPERSAL Passive ‘Assisted Active Airborne Waterborne Animal Vector Attachment Dormancy Germination 1. PASSIVE 2.

Boundary Layer Sedimentation rates depend on particle size Still air Moving air Grass pollen grains (30μm diam ) are transported long distances in moving air 10 μm diam cell falls 1m in 5 min (in still air). 1 μm cell falls 100x slower Burkard trap for capturing spores/pollen SARS-CoV-2 transmission: Droplets vs Aerosols Origins of the ‘2 metre rule’ Aerosol (<10μm) Droplet nuclei (dried)At 3% solid matter: 50μm diameter (=65pL volume = 65ng weight) evaporates to 15.5μm diameter (=2pL volume = 2ng weight) 30μm diameter (=14pL volume = 14ng wt) evaporates to 9μm diameter (=65pL volume = 0.4ng wt) 10μm diameter (=0.5pL volume = 0.5ng wt) evaporates to 3μm diameter (=0.015pL volume = 0.015ng wt) Dried saliva not individual virions are inhaled SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission: Droplets vs Aerosols Rapid evaporation (saliva 2-5% solids) mucin/salts SARS-CoV-2 can remain infective in aerosols for >16hr (van Doremalen, 2020). Sensitive to UV (sunlight) and heat (killed by 30min@60ºC) Survives better at low (indoor) humidity (Smither, 2020 #595). Protected in congealed mucus DISPERSAL BY ANIMAL VECTORS 1.

Bieber, J.]) Borrelia burgdorferi (spirochaete) 1st isolated by Willy Burgdorfer (1982) 0.3µm W, 5-20µm L (Gram –ve; no LPS in outer membrane) 19 Borrelia spp. globally (B. garinii / B. afzelii co-occur in Europe with Bb) Ixodes spp. (I. ricinus in Europe) tick host (egg-larva-nymph-adult) Competent (can infect tick with Bb) vs non-competent (eg. deer) host reservoirs Ticks sit on vegetation and latch onto passing hosts Symptoms initially after 2wks (Erythema migrans -80% of cases), viral-like symptoms, later arthritic/neurological problems Ancient disease (>5000yrs; Ötzi the Iceman was infected with Bb) Strong climatic patterns due to tick behavior Nymphs on smaller hosts, adults on larger (usually) Humans are dead-end (non –competent) host for Bb. (Class III zoonosis- symptoms only in H). Ticks require vertebrate blood Co-infection with Babesia microti (Babesiosis; protozoan) and Anaplasma phagocytophilum (bacterium; Human granulocytic anaplasmosis) common (1-40%) Ixodes ricinus Borrelia spirochaetes Life cycles (European) of: A) Ixodes ricinus tick B) Borrelia spp. 2-3 yr tick life cycle X (deer) =non-competent host for Borrelia spp. B. garinii -bird vectors (neurological symptoms in H) END","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
