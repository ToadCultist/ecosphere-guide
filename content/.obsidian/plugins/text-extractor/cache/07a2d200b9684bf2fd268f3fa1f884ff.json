Definition of “algae” • “ALGAE” a term abandoned as a taxonomic term but it is still used by biologists today… “…unless purely artificial limits are drawn the designation algae must include holophytic (photosynthetic via chl. a) organisms (as well as their numerous colourless derivatives) that fail to reach the level of differentiation characteristic of archegoniate plants (e.g. mosses, liverworts and ferns).” Fritsch (1935). “Algae” • The term “algae” covers a huge range of species from unicellular, colonial to multicellular. • Many classes have both uni- and multicellular representatives. • Found across a range of aquatic habitats: marine, brackish, freshwater, hot springs etc. …and terrestrial: soils, snow, rock, desert soils etc. • They have some of the fastest growth rates……and some of the highest levels of C fixation. • At the base of all aquatic food chains. • Very important mitigators of climate change. Evolution of Photosynthesis • The ability to photosynthesize evolved in the Bacteria. • Cyanobacteria (blue green algae) are oxygenic photosynthesizers: produce O2. • All others are anoxygenic. Endosymbiosis • Evolutionary history of the main algal groups. • Primary endosymbiotic event of a cyanobacterium and protist. • Subsequent secondary and tertiary endosymbiotic events. Rothschild (2004) J. Eukaryotic Microbiol. chloroplast Primary host cell mitochondrion Primary host cell nucleus cyanobacterium Red alga Glaucophyte Green alga Primary host α-proteobacterium? 1° Endosymbiosis • Modern day photosynthetic organisms all evolved from the endosymbiosis of one ancestral cyanobacterium. • Primary endosymbiotic event: plastid has two membranes. Endosymbiosis • Evolutionary history of the main algal groups. • Primary endosymbiotic event of a cyanobacterium and protist. • Subsequent secondary and tertiary endosymbiotic events. 2° Endosymbiosis • Green and red algae underwent a secondary endosymbiotic event…. • 2° endosymbiotic event: secondary plastid has three membranes (nucleus and mitochondria degenerate). Plastid (2 membranes): cyanobacterium inner and outer membrane. Primary host cell mitochondrion Primary host cell nucleus cyanobacterium Dinoflagellate… Red/green alga? Secondary host Primary host α-proteobacterium? Plastid (4 membranes): cyanobacterial inner and outer membrane, red algal wall (dashed) and secondary phagosomal membrane Plastid (3 membranes): cyanobacterial inner and outer membrane and 2° phagosomal membrane (chloroplast ER) 2° Endosymbiosis • 2° endosymbiotic event: secondary plastid has four membranes (nucleus from the primary endosymbiotic event remains as a reduced form: nucleomorph).

Endosymbiosis • Evolutionary history of the main algal groups. • Primary endosymbiotic event of a cyanobacterium and protist. • Subsequent secondary and tertiary endosymbiotic events. 2° Endosymbiosis • Secondary endosymbiotic event lead to the evolution of the following: ….with a GREEN ALGAL cell…occurred at least twice. ✓Euglenids: most contain green plastids; plastids have three membranes. ✓Chlorarachinophytes: rare marine amoeboflagellates and flagellates; contain a nucleomorph; plastid has four membranes. 2° Endosymbiosis ….with a RED ALGAL cell…occurred multiple times. ✓Haptophytes: marine flagellates; plastids have four membranes. ✓Cryptomonads: plastid has four membranes; has a nucleomorph. ✓Stramenopiles: includes diatoms and macroalgae; plastid has four membranes. 2° Endosymbiosis ….with a RED ALGAL cell…occurred multiple times. ✓Apicomplexa: obligate intracellular parasites, contains an apicoplast thought to be a relic plastid. ✓Dinoflagellates: plastid has three membranes; subsequent lost and reacquisition of plastids?? Endosymbiosis • Subsequent serial secondary: ….Endosymbiosis of a cell derived by primary endosymbiotic event (green algae; symbiont) being phagocytosed by the host (dinoflagellate; itself having been derived from a secondary endosymbiotic event). Dinoflagellate (2°) consumes a green algal cell (1°). Secondary secondary = serial secondary….!! Endosymbiosis • Subsequent tertiary: ….Endosymbiosis of a cell derived by secondary endosymbiotic event (diatom etc.; symbiont) being phagocytosed by the host (dinoflagellate; itself having been derived from a secondary endosymbiotic event). Dinoflagellate (2°) consumes a diatom/haptophyte/ crypotomond (2°). = Tertiary….!! Serial 2° Endosymbiosis ✓Lepidodinium chlorophorum and L. viride: serial secondary with a green alga. • Dinoflagellates are thought to have undergone serial secondary endosymbiosis: Serial 2° Endosymbiosis ✓Durinskia agilis & D. baltica: tertiary endosymbiosis with a diatom. ✓Karlodinium (13 spp.): tertiary endosymbiosis with a haptophyte. ✓Dinophysis (265 spp.): tertiary endosymbiosis with a cryptomonad. • Dinoflagellates are thought to have undergone tertiary endosymbiosis: Cyanobacteria ✓ Chlorophyll a (Chl a). ✓ Phycobiliproteins. ✓ Gram negative bacteria. ✓ Circular fibrils of DNA. ✓ Singular thylakoids. • All eukaryotic photosynthesisers evolved from the 1° endosymbotic event with an ancestral cyanobacterium called chloroxybacteria. • Evolved 2.5 billion years ago (in freshwater?). • Characteristic features: Characteristic Features of Phytoplankton Cell Wall Photosynthetic Pigments Thylakoid Arrangement Cell Wall • Prokaryotes have a double membrane with a peptidoglycan layer in between: • These two membranes are RETAINED and remain around the chloroplast. • In the Glaucophyta the peptidoglycan layer is retained – in all other groups it has been lost. • The phagosomal membrane is LOST.

Plastid 1 2 3 4 Photosynthetic Pigments • Algae have four types of chlorophyll a, b, c (c1 & c2), d. • Chl a always present. • Variety of accessory pigments: ✓ Carotenoids: carotenes and xanthophylls. ✓ Phycobiliproteins: phycocyanin and phycoerythrin. Photosynthetic Pigments • Thought that Chl a evolved first then Chl b & c. • But the discovery of Chl d caused confusion! • Chl d found in some cyanobacteria: Acaryochloris marina. Possibly evolved “late”. • Evolution of pigments complex! • Phycobiliproteins lost in green algae due to “chance events”. • All others lost as a consequence of the evolution of LHCs which gave rise to the other chlorophylls.
