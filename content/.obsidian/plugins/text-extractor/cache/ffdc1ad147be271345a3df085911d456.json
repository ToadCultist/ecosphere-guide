Cancer develops when normal cell-cycle control stops working. Some cancers form a mass of tissue, called a tumour. Other cancers, such as leukaemia, do not form tumours. Mitosis and meiosis occur only when needed -in time and in space. Normally highly regulated by inter- and intracellular signals Eg. cell division during human embryo development must be highly coordinated But it can go wrong…. Very rare (5 per million births). But only a 10% chance of survival Virus-Causing Cancer Dr Peyton Rous early 1900s A sample of sarcoma is obtained from a chicken. The tumor is ground up, suspended, and centrifuged to create an extract. The extract is injected into a healthy chicken. The chicken develops a tumor at the site of injection. The filtered cell-free extract is injected into a healthy chicken. The chicken develops a tumor at the site of injection. The extract is passed through a filter to remove cells and bacteria. However most cancers are NOT caused by viruses. A second example of a cancer-causing virus was not found for another 25 years. However, Rous’ work led to the discovery of specific gene mutations that cause the more common types of cancer Cancer-causing viruses possess altered versions of normal host genes that control cell division Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are a group of more than 150 related viruses. They are called papillomaviruses because some of them cause papillomas, which are more commonly known as warts. Some types of HPV only grow in skin, while others grow in mucous membranes such as the mouth, throat, anus, penis or vagina. Other HPVs cause cervical cancerThe universal HPV vaccination programme In England and Wales, all boys and girls aged 12 to 13 years (born after 1 September 2006) are routinely offered the 1st HPV vaccination when they're in Year 8 at school. The 2nd dose is offered 6 to 24 months after the 1st dose. If you're eligible and miss the HPV vaccine offered in Year 8 at school, it's available for free on the NHS up until your 25th birthday for: girls born after 1 September 1991 boys born after 1 September 2006. The vaccine is effective at stopping people getting the high-risk types of HPV that cause cancer, including most cervical cancers and some anal, genital, mouth and throat (head and neck) cancers.  https://phw.nhs.wales/topics/immunisation-and-vaccines/vaccination-information1/hpv/ Cyclins activate cyclin-dependent kinases to regulate progression through the cell cycle. 1 Cyclin Cyclin- dependent kinase (CDK) Cyclin-CDK complex Cyclin degrades Target protein Cyclin-CDK phosphorylate target proteins that control cell division. 2 Phosphorylated cell-cycle activation protein P Cancer is characterized by uncontrolled cell division. The cell cycle is controlled by cyclins and the enzymes they activate (CDKs) CDKs are always present but are active enzymes only when cyclin is present Progression Through the Cell Cycle UK scientist Tim Hunt fed radioactive methionine to sea urchin embryos as they underwent mitosis and watched how it was incorporated. The level of one protein (Cyclin) went up and down with each round of mitosis. Level of cyclin increases and decreases, and then increases and decreases again as the embryo divides by mitosis. Interphase – Mitosis – Interphase – Mitosis – Interphase Time (hours)Cyclin level M cyclin–CDK helps prepare the cell for mitosis. S cyclin–CDK helps initiate DNA synthesis. M G2 G1 S G1/S cyclin–CDK complex prepares cell for DNA replication. Interphase There are three main types of Cyclin-CDK Complexes Each regulates a different step in the cell cycle We can think of cyclins and CDKs as the ‘engines’ that drive cell division. M G2 G1 S Interphase ? ? ? Spindle assembly checkpoint (before anaphase): Are all chromosomes correctly attached to the spindle? DNA replication checkpoint (at the end of G2): Is all DNA replicated? DNA damage checkpoint (before entering S phase): Is DNA damaged / rearranged? Eg P53 Checkpoints There are also ‘checkpoints’ that can stop or slow cell division if something is not correct. An example is a protein called P53 that acts at the end of G1 and allows DNA to be replicated only if is intact and in good condition. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsBHu07j4Dg Watch the video on the cell cycle that describes it’s main parts and shows the three tumour suppressor checkpoints (1 min 50 sec) Proto-oncogenes encode factors that promote normal cell division. Eg. cyclins & CDK Tumour suppressor genes encode factors that slow down normal cell division. Eg. cell-cycle checkpoint controllers like p53 The cell-cycle is regulated by genes encoding antagonistic control mechanisms However specific mutations in either proto-oncogenes or tumour-suppressor genes can cause cancer. Genes involved in cell-cycle regulation and cancer • Proto-oncogene: a ‘normal’ gene that promotes the division of normal cells (eg. genes encoding cyclins, CDK etc). [proto = first /original]. Humans possess around 75 of these. Proto-oncogenes can become oncogenes (ie. cancer-causing) following mutation. • Tumour suppressor genes code for ‘normal‘ negative regulator proteins: the type of regulators that, when activated, can prevent the cell from undergoing uncontrolled division. Can also cause cancer after mutation. Mutations in the checkpoint gene p53 have been found in more than half of human cancers. • Proto-oncogenes become oncogenes when they are permanently activated. • Tumour suppressor genes cause cancer when they are inactivated. Specific mutations in proto-oncogenes can cause cancer. For example, a mutation that allows CDK to be activated without being partnered with cyclin would push the cell division too fast. Like a car with the gas pedal always down. However, the check-point controls would still be working (car can still control speed via brakes) Specific mutations in tumour-suppressor genes can also cause cancer. For example, a mutation that blocks the cell cycles check points from operating correctly would mean the cell did not do its normal checks. Like a car with no brakes. However, the cell cycle activators would still be working correctly (car not going too fast anyway) Normally cancers result only after multiple mutations Proto-oncogenes must mutate to form active oncogenes And, in same cell, mutations must block correct action of tumour suppressor genes. Ie the car has its ‘pedal to the metal’ AND has no brakes Defective tumour suppressor gene (no brakes) Active oncogene (over revving engine) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46Xh7OFkkCE Watch the video on the cellular causes of cancer. Specifically from 5 min 30 sec onward to see a description of proto-oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes (total length 12 min 07 sec). Multiple Mutation Model for Cancer Development Activation of oncogene Inactivation of second tumor suppressor gene Inactivation of first tumor suppressor gene Inactivation of third tumor suppressor gene Normal looking cells Benign (non- invasive cancer Malignant (invasive) cancer Metastasis (Secondary tumor) at a new site Metastatic cancer + + + Invasive cancers also send signals for increased blood flow (angiogenesis)Additional key terms and concepts Most cancers form tumours, but not all tumours are cancerous. Non-cancerous (benign) tumours, such as freckles and moles, stop growing, do not spread to other parts of the body, and do not create new tumours. Malignant, or cancerous, tumours crowd out healthy cells, interfere with body functions, and draw nutrients from body tissues. Cancers are classified by where they originate in the body. Carcinoma. Originate in tissues which either cover surfaces or line internal organs. Eg. breast, prostate, lung, intestine, skin, pancreas, liver, kidneys, and bladder. 80 to 90 percent of all cancer cases are carcinomas. Lymphomas are cancers of lymphocytes. Leukaemia is cancer of the (mainly white) blood cells. It does not usually form solid tumours. Sarcomas arise in connective tissues eg. muscle, fat, bone, or cartilage and are relatively uncommon. Melanomas are cancers that arise in the cells that make the pigment in skin.","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":""}
