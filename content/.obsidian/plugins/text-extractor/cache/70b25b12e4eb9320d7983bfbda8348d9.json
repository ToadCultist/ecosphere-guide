Cyclostomes?)  Evolution of mineralisation (bones & teeth). Recap  Kingdom Animalia: 2 major categories of animals  Invertebrates - lack notochord  Vertebrates ~ 66,178 extant spp.  Variety forms & life histories – Fish – most abundant >32,000 sp. – Amphibians – Reptiles & birds – Mammals Protostomes and deuterostomes Chordata Subphylum Urochordata Subphylum Cephalochordata Myxinoides Chondrichthyes Aves Eutheria Ancestral Deuterostome Protostomes Echinodermata Hemichordata (Cavalier-Smith, 1998) Major eukaryote lineages diversified in Precambrian A proposed eukaryote phylogeny. Image from http://tolweb.org/Eukaryotes Evolution of animals Common protist ancestor Choanoflagellates Animals Fungi Single posterior flagellum (if present) Absorptive heterotrophy Chitin in cell walls Opisthokonts The chordates  Include both non- vertebrates & vertebrates Chordate characteristics: – Dorsal hollow nerve cord – Notochord – Post-anal tail – Pharyngeal gill slits – Importance of embryology. The chordates 3 subphyla  Urochordates (Tunicata - Sea squirts, larvaceans & salps).  Cephalochordates (Lancelet, Branchiostoma).  Craniates (including hagfish & vertebrates).  Hemichordates considered separate phylum. Evolution of adult tadpole-like body plan…  Vertebrates & cephalochordates thought to have evolved via paedomorphosis.  Paedomorphosis – Larva - sexually mature without reaching adult body form – Neoteny (retention larval/embryonic characteristics past time of reproductive maturity) – Progenesis (accelerated development of reproductive organs relative to somatic tissue) Non-vertebrate chordates live in the seas…  Urochordata (Tunicates, ~2800 spp.) – 3 classes (sea squirts, salps, larvaceans) – Ascideans (sea squirts) best known – Adults sessile – Larvae free-swimming  all chordate features present.  Cephalochordates (~35 spp.) – All chordate features present in adults e.g. Branchiostoma Samuel Chow - originally posted to Flickr as Ascidian (Rhopalaea Crassa) (4 cm), CC BY 2.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php ?curid=5179874 Craniates are chordates that have a cranium…  Cranium – “skull”. Derived craniate characteristics  2 clusters Homeobox (Hox) genes.  Neural crest – embryonic source of many unique craniate characteristics.  Raised metabolism.  More extensive musculature.  Heart with at least 2 chambers.  Haemoglobin in red blood cells.  Kidneys. Craniates are chordates that have a cranium…  Neural crest – special type of embryonic tissue – e.g. forms peripheral nervous system & myelin sheath. Origin of craniates…  Late 1990s early chordate fossils found in China – Formed 530 MYA - Cambrian explosion  Most primitive - 3cm Haikouella  Resembled lancelets – Mouth structure – suspension feeder  Also some craniate characteristics – Large well formed brain – Small eyes? – Muscle segments along body – Respiratory gills in pharynx – No skull or ear organs Origin of craniates…  More advanced chordate fossil Myllokunmingia  ~ 3cm  Had – Ear and eye capsules – Parts of skull that surround eyes & ears  Myllokunmingia regarded as true craniate – Based on these & other characteristics Professor Simon Conway-Morris https://www.esc.cam.ac.uk/directory/simon-conway-morris Myxini the least derived surviving craniate lineage…  Myxini – hagfishes.  Skull - cartilage.  Lack jaws – superclass Agnatha? Sister group to verts. Cyclostomes?  Lack vertebrae.  Snakelike swimming motion – muscles generate force against notochord.  Small brain, eyes & ears.  Nasal opening connects with pharynx. http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/vertebrates/basalfish/m yxini.html Myxini the least derived surviving craniate lineage…  Tooth-like formations made of keratin.  ~ 80 extant species – marine.  Up to 60cm in length.  Mostly bottom-dwelling scavengers – Feed on annelid worms, sick/dead fish. Abel Barnett slideplayer.com/slide/6333642/ Myxini the least derived surviving craniate lineage…  Slime glands – produce substance absorbs H2O.  Slime – may repulse other scavengers. – Produce several L slime < 1minute. – Slime coats gills – attacker retreats / suffocates.  Production artificial slime - space filling gel – surgical application? http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/vertebrates/basalfis h/myxini.html www.weblearneng.com/hagfish Vertebrates are craniates that have a vertebral column…  After branching off from other craniates verts underwent another gene duplication – Transcription factor genes Dlx family. – Genetic complexity - innovations nervous system & skeleton?  Some vertebrates – vertebrae - cartilage  Majority vertebrates – vertebrae enclose spinal cord – notochord role.  Aquatic vertebrates – fins stiffened by fin rays – swimming. Vertebrates are craniates that have a vertebral column…  Embryonic notochord surrounded/replaced by vertebral column  Composed of bone or cartilage  Function of vertebral column – Supports body – Attachment sites for muscles – Protects nerve cord & brain – Internal skeletal component – can grow & repair Common characteristics of phylum Vertebrata…  Vertebrates – all chordate features plus:  Vertebral column  (cartilaginous/bony vertebrae) replaces notochord.  Skull (cranium) - brain.  Well developed circulatory system.  Internal organs suspended in coelom. Others:  3 part brain (forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain).  Duplication Hox gene complex.  Neural crest cells. http://tolweb.org/Craniata Petromyzontida represent the oldest living lineage of vertebrates…  Petromyzontida – lampreys.  ~50 species – marine & freshwater.  Most adults are parasitic – feed on fish – Round jawless mouth – superclass Agnatha? Cyclostomes? – Rasping tongue – ingest blood & tissues. – Anticoagulant – oral gland. Eric Vanetten https://www.slideshare.net/ericavanetten/lab-1- vertebrate-evolution-1474563 www.columbia.edu/itc/cerc/danoff- burg/invasion_bio/inv_spp_summ/petromyzon_marinus.html Petromyzontida represent the oldest living lineage of vertebrates…  Larval lampreys – freshwater suspension feeders.  Some species only feed as larvae.  Most migrate – sea/lakes as mature into adults.  Sea lampreys (Petromyzon marinus) – Invaded Great Lakes over the past 170 years – devastating fisheries. www.seagrant.umn.edu/ais/sealamprey Great Lakes and Aquatic Sciences Archives, University of Michigan Petromyzontida represent the oldest living lineage of vertebrates…  Skeleton – cartilage – contains no collagen – stiff protein matrix.  Notochord persists in adult – axial skeleton.  Also cartilaginous pipe around notochord – pairs of cartilaginous projections related to vertebrae extend dorsally – partially enclosing nerve cord. Campbell & Reece Biology, 2009. Early vertebrates (fossils)  Conodonts (“cone teeth”)  No jaws  Slender, soft- bodied – ~3-10cm long (up to 30cm)  V. abundant >300 million years  Probably hunters – Prominent eyes – Mineralised (phosphatic) barbed hooks anterior mouth – Food passed back to pharynx  Different dental elements – crushing & slicing https://www.jsg.utexas.edu/npl/collections/microfossils/ Later vertebrates (fossils)…  Emerged during Ordovician, Silurian & Devonian Additional innovations  Paired fins  Inner ear - 2 semicircular canals – balance.  No jaws – Muscular pharynx – suck in other organisms/detritus.  Armoured - mineralised bone – sometimes spines – Protection  Many species e.g. Pteraspis & Pharyngolepis – all extinct by end Devonian. Origins of bone & teeth…  Vert skeleton originally evolved as structure made of unmineralised cartilage. What initiated mineralisation in verts?  Hypothesis – Mineralisation associated with transition in feeding mechanisms?  Early verts – probably suspension feeders.  Over time body size increased – ingest larger particles? http://tolweb.org/Craniata Origins of bone & teeth…  Earliest known mineralised vertebrate structures – conodont dental elements – Facilitated scavenging & predation.  Armour in later jawless verts derived from dental mineralisation – Mineralisation of vert body may have begun in mouth.  Only in more derived verts does endoskeleton become mineralised - starting with skull. http://tolweb.org/Craniata Today we have explored...  Evolution of vertebrates from other chordates.  Introduction to jawless fish (Agnathans? Cyclostomes?).  Evolution of mineralisation (bones & teeth). Next session…  Gnathostomes & evolution of jaws.  Chondrichthyes & Osteichthyes  Tetrapod origins Title slide image attributions The Three Domains of Life: https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_(biology) Phylogentic tree of life: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_life_(biology) A 2016 (metagenomic) representation of the tree of life: Laura A.
