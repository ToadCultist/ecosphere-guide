Fall or scatter • Water © Chloe Griffiths From flower to seed & fruit Ovule → seed Ovary (flower) Fruit Ovary wall → ‘pericarp’ Carpel Fruits with dry pericarp: ‘pod’ High protein in cotyledons → ‘split peas’ Pisum sativum pea Fruits with dry pericarp: ‘grain’ • Poaceae: grass family • Cereals: oats, barley, wheat Oats Barley Wheat Endosperm ‘Germ’ (embryo) ‘Bran’ (pericarp) Fruits with dry pericarp: ‘grain’ • White flour from endosperm: mainly carbohydrate • Bran & germ in ‘wholegrain’ flour • Historical reason for white flour: fatty acids in ‘germ’ taste rancid when oxidized in storage Endosperm ‘Germ’ (embryo) ‘Bran’ (pericarp) Wheat’s unique ‘dough’ from grain endosperm • Endosperm: starch in protein matrix • Bonding of glutenin & gliadin proteins → ‘gluten’ • Uniquely viscoelastic ‘dough’ Endosperm Fruits with dry pericarp: ‘grain’ • Maize and rice also in Poaceae • Maize, rice, wheat = 60% of global food energy intake Maize Rice Fruits with dry pericarp: ‘nut’ Nuts have a hard thick pericarp Oak fruitFemale oak flowers Ash fruit Fruits with dry pericarp: ‘samara’ Samaras have wings for wind dispersal Maple fruit Buttercup flower Ranunculaceae Fruits with dry pericarp: ‘achene’ Achenes ripening from separate carpels Buttercup fruit One-seed fruits with pericarp free from seed coat Dandelion flower Asteraceae Achenes ripening from separate florets Fruit have ‘pappus’ for wind dispersal Fruits with dry pericarp: ‘achene’ One-seed fruits with pericarp free from seed coat Sunflower crop Asteraceae Fruits with dry pericarp: ‘achene’ • One-seed fruits with pericarp free from seed coat • ‘Sunflower hearts’ easy to extract from black pericarp • Oil-rich cotyledons: cooking oil & bird food Sunflower ‘hearts’ Seeds in pericarps Yellow flag • Capsule derived from several carpels splits to release seed • Seed have buoyancy tissues for water dispersal Fruits with dry pericarp: ‘capsule’ Iris pseudacorus Fruits with dry pericarp: ‘capsule’ Opium poppy • Ovary with multiple carpels • Seeds shed through pores at top of capsule • Opioids (morphine, codeine, etc) in latex of capsule Cotton • Capsule splits to release seed • Cotton fibres: single-celled hairs on seed • 20,000 can form on fertilized ovule Fruits with dry pericarp: ‘capsule’ Fibre Seed Ovule Ovary wall Pericarp Exocarp Mesocarp Endocarp Ovule becomes seed Ovary (flower) Fruit From flower to seed & fleshy fruit ‘Berry’ – entirely fleshy pericarp Fruits with fleshy pericarp: ‘berry’ Tomato • Exocarp & mesocarp fleshy Ovaries can consist of fused carpels Fused carpels → chambers in ovary Fruit from ovary with one carpel Fruit from ovary with multiple carpels Fruits with fleshy pericarp: ‘berry’ Citrus fruits • Leathery rind = exocarp • Segments = carpels • Juicy tissue = vesicles of endocarp cells Fruits with fleshy pericarp: ‘berry’ Pomegranate - Forms from inferior ovary – residual stamens on topCocoa • Seeds fermented in heaps, then sun-dried to commodity ‘cocoa beans’ Fruits with fleshy pericarp: ‘berry’ Fruits with fleshy pericarp: ‘berry’ Cocoa • Manufacturer roasts & mills • Natural components → flavours • Add sugar, milk, extra flavours for chocolate Coffee berries have two seeds, mostly endosperm Fruits with fleshy pericarp: ‘berry’ Pericarps removed & seeds separated then roasted to ‘coffee beans’ From flower to seed & fleshy fruit ‘Drupe’ – fleshy exocarp & mesocarp, with seed encased in hard endocarp Ovary wall Pericarp Exocarp Mesocarp Endocarp Ovule becomes seed Ovary (flower) Fruit Fruits with hard endocarp: ‘drupe’ Peach - Woody endocarp protects seed in animal’s gut Undomesticated “wild” peach Multiple fruit: from many flowers Aggregate fruit: from flower with many carpels Fruits with fleshy pericarp: ‘compound fruits’ ‘Accessory’ fruits with tissues not from ovary Strawberry • Flesh from receptacle  seeds on outside Apple • Flesh partly from tissues at base of flower • ‘Frugivores’: birds, mammals, ants • Ovary wall of flower → ‘pericarp’ of typical fruits • Fruits with ‘dry’ pericarps dispersed by variety of mechanisms • Entirely ‘fleshy’ fruits = ‘berries’, or if ‘endocarp’ is woody = ‘drupes’ • ‘Compound’ fruits from multiple carpels or flowers • All these categories contain major crops SummaryImage acknowledgments Wikimedia Commons, https://commons.wikimedia.org Campbell & Reece (2008) Biology, 8th edn.
