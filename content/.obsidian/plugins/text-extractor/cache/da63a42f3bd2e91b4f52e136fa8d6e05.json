Questions to investigate: Iris pseudacorus normally grows in wetland, so will it be more sensitive to drought than the broad bean? But the freshwater habitats of Iris pseudacorus can dry up, so does this wetland exhibit drought tolerance like Bryophyllum daigremontianum? Procedure Each group of four will sample 3 plants of each species, from each of the two benches: drought (note date displayed when watering stopped) and control (watered daily). Your group therefore collect 18 experimental samples in total. Determine ‘relative water content’ as follows. Avoid dead or yellowing leaves. Take leaves from the same part of the plant for each sample. 1. Using a cork borer, punch disks (10 mm diameter) from each plant, and weigh (record as ‘fresh’ weight, Wf). Weigh soon after punching disks - they will be drying out if left. 2. Float the disks on water in a multi-well dish for 45 minutes. Make sure every disc is in good contact with the water - discs stuck to the lid or stacked on each other are the main source of error in this class. Also, clearly mark the wells! While you wait for your disks to take up water in the petri dishes visit the neighbouring Tropical Glasshouse. 3. After the 45 minutes, gently blot the discs with a paper towel to remove surface water, and re-weigh (record as ‘turgid’ weight, Wt). 4. Each group should end their class by filling in one of the ‘Datasheets’ with their names and results, and hand in to the lecturer. PLEASE WRITE LEGIBLY - an Excel file with the class results will be uploaded to Blackboard following the end of the last practical class. 5. Class data will be used to calculate relative water content, RWC, using the following equation: Wf RWC (%) = ----- x 100 Wt Group members (username, e.g. dwp): Species Treatment Fresh weight (Wf) (g) Turgid weight (Wt) (g) Vicia faba Control Vicia faba Control Vicia faba Control Vicia faba Drought Vicia faba Drought Vicia faba Drought Bryophyllum Control Bryophyllum Control Bryophyllum Control Bryophyllum Drought Bryophyllum Drought Bryophyllum Drought Iris pseudacorus Control Iris pseudacorus Control Iris pseudacorus Control Iris pseudacorus Drought Iris pseudacorus Drought Iris pseudacorus Drought","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
