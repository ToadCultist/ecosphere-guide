BR/BG/RD/RG2750 Research Methods • A long, thin module building essential skills for your degree, and your career • Semester 1: Data analysis skills – Statistics assignment (50%) • Semester 2: Research planning skills – Research plan assignment (50%) Why do we need to learn to use statistics? So that we can properly design & analyse our experiments! So that we can properly evaluate the science we read! Employability! Analysis skills are in demand beyond science! So that we can analyse the massive amount of data that is available already! To develop our critical thinking skills! Because you will need to use these skills in other modules! How this semester will work… • Each week you’ll have a lecture on a statistical method • Then you will have a linked ‘how to’ video* and practical task, with a quiz to complete that week (because you’ll learn best by doing!) • At the end of the semester you will have an overall online test *These will be available throughout your course to refer back to when you need them Week Lecture Practical Weekly Quiz Online Test 6 X 7 X X X 8 X X 9 X X 10 X X 11 12 X X 13 X X 14 X X 15 X X 16 X X Practical tasks and weekly quizzes… • Timetabled practical next week to get you started • After that, will be smaller online tasks done in your own time • Quiz questions should be completed before the next Monday lecture (i.e. you have a week) Week Lecture Practical Weekly Quiz Online Test 6 X 7 X X X 8 X X 9 X X 10 X X 11 12 X X 13 X X 14 X X 15 X X 16 X X Final online test • Will be completed in final week, before 12.00 midday Friday • Unseen questions testing your knowledge of statistics broadly Week Lecture Practical Weekly Quiz Online Test 6 X 7 X X X 8 X X 9 X X 10 X X 11 12 X X 13 X X 14 X X 15 X X 16 X X Statistics assessment (worth 50% of module) • Weekly quizzes give you a practical mark (20% of assessment) – Attempt 7/8 quizzes & get an average across quizzes >50% = full marks for this component – Attempt <7 quizzes but still get an average across quizzes >50% = half marks – This mark is really a reward for trying! • Final online test gives you an understanding mark (80% of assessment) …but I struggle with maths! • Don’t panic! Biologists rarely carry out statistical calculations by hand • Can you use a microwave? • Do you know how it works? • Could you build one? You will learn to use R • A hugely powerful, free, software environment for statistics and graphics • R is now THE industry standard in biological sciences • Many, many scientific jobs specifically ask for competence in using R • Get confident with R and it will open up a world of data analysis and graph plotting opportunities What if I need help? • It’s really important to carry out the weekly tasks and challenge yourself • If you get stuck, you can post questions/problems to the Blackboard forum • You can also approach me after a lecture • I’ll provide answers on the forum, or during the next lecture How can I do well? • Complete the online work on a weekly basis and engage with the lectures! 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 0 20 40 60 80 100Statistics assignment grade (%) Lecture attendance (%) 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5Statistics assignment grade (%) Online engagement (Log(minutes+1)) BR/BG/RD/RG27520 Research Methods 1.2 Introduction to statistical hypothesis testing Dr Roger Santer, rds5@aber.ac.uk Differences in behaviour between dog breeds • Gácsi et al. (2009) investigated the ability of dogs to comprehend human body language cues • They hypothesised that breeds selected to work in cooperation with humans (like sheepdogs and gundogs) would be better at reading human cues than breeds selected to work in isolation (like livestock guard dogs, hounds, and those used for underground hunting) Gácsi et al. (2009) Effects of selection for cooperation and attention in dogs. Behavioral and Brain Functions, 5: 31 Lukas Ruzicka Differences in behaviour between dog breeds • They randomly selected 30 cooperative breed dogs, and 30 independent breed dogs • In each trial, a dog had to choose between two food bowls, and the experimenter indicated the correct choice by pointing at it • For each dog, the % of correct food bowl choices was recorded Gácsi et al. (2009) Effects of selection for cooperation and attention in dogs. Behavioral and Brain Functions, 5: 31 Here’s a representation of their data… The data seem to support the hypothesis… But the researchers haven’t tested the entire populations of independent and cooperative breed dogs, they’re just dealing with a small sample 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Independent (n=30) Cooperative (n=30)% of correct choices (mean ± SEM) Breed type Within a population, dogs vary in perceptivity Very perceptiveNumber of dogs Not very perceptive Back to the data… So, is it possible that the researchers just have 30 particularly perceptive individuals in their cooperative sample? And 30 particularly unperceptive individuals in their independent sample? i.e. might this apparent difference just be an effect of random sampling? 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Independent (n=30) Cooperative (n=30)% of correct choices (mean ± SEM) Breed type Applying a hypothesis test First, we must define our null hypothesis (Ho) In this case, “there is no difference in % correct choices between breed types” We will use statistics to test this idea 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Independent (n=30) Cooperative (n=30)% of correct choices (mean ± SEM) Breed type Applying a hypothesis test The alternate hypothesis (HA) is the idea that must be true if the null hypothesis is false In this case, “there is a significant difference in % correct choices between breed types” 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Independent (n=30) Cooperative (n=30)% of correct choices (mean ± SEM) Breed type Applying a hypothesis test We run a statistical test to obtain a p value, which tells us the probability of getting a difference as extreme, or more extreme, than this if the null hypothesis were true (= the probability of getting a difference like this just because of random sampling variation) 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Independent (n=30) Cooperative (n=30)% of correct choices (mean ± SEM) Breed type In biology, we typically reject Ho when p<0.05 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Independent (n=30) Cooperative (n=30)% of correct choices (mean ± SEM) Breed type In biology, we typically reject Ho when p<0.05 e.g., p = 0.541. There’s a high chance of getting these data if the null were true, so we can’t reject it e.g., p = 0.001. There’s a very low chance of getting these data if the null were true, so we reject it 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Independent (n=30) Cooperative (n=30)% of correct choices (mean ± SEM) Breed type Applying a hypothesis test In this case, p=0.030 Data like these are very unlikely if the null hypothesis were true In fact, sufficiently unlikely (p<0.05) that we can reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternate hypothesis 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Independent (n=30) Cooperative (n=30)% of correct choices (mean ± SEM) Breed type Applying a hypothesis test There is a significant difference in % correct choices between independent and cooperative breed dogs! 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Independent (n=30) Cooperative (n=30)% of correct choices (mean ± SEM) Breed type Important concepts to take away • Null hypothesis (H0) • Alternate hypothesis (HA) • P value • Reject H0 if p<0.05","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
