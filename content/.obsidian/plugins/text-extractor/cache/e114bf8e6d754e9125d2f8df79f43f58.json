Osmoregulation and Excretion • What is excretion…? …Elimination of metabolic waste products e.g. CO2, H2O and nitrogenous compounds. • What is osmoregulation…? …Regulation of water and ion balance in body fluids. • In many animals osmoregulatory and excretory organs are the same. Osmoregulation and Excretion • What are their respective functions…? …Excretion = rid the body of toxic waste. …Osmoregulation = maintain concentration and ion balance in body fluids. • In many animals osmoregulatory and excretory organs are structurally and functionally linked. Factors Involved • Membranes are permeable to solvent (water) and solutes (ions). • Diffusion is the movement of solutes from a high concentration to a low concentration – passive. • Osmosis is the movement of the solvent from less to more concentrated solutions – passive. • Osmosis is driven by differences in osmotic pressure between solutions. Osmotic States • Isosmotic: animal has the same osmotic concentration as the external environment. • Hyperosmotic: animal has a higher osmotic concentration than the external environment. • Hyposmotic: animal has a lower osmotic concentration than the external environment. Anima l Environmen t Hyperosmotic State Anima l Environmen t Hyposmotic State Anima l Environmen t Isosmotic State Osmotic States • The movement of the solvent (water) and the solute (ions) across a semipermeable membrane depends on:  Gradient.  Permeability.  Surface area. • Hold true across the animal kingdom. Principles…. • The ions and water are the same concentrations on both sides of the membrane – equal exchange across the membrane. • The concentrations of ions and water are different. • The water and ions will move down a concentration gradient until an equilibrium is reached. Principles…. • If a concentration difference is to be maintained for both water and ions active transport is required. • Ion pumps on the membrane use ATP to move ions against their concentration gradient. • These pumps often exchange more than one ion: Na+/K+ ATPase etc. • Symport (same direction) and antiport (opposite) exchange mechanisms. • They constantly work as ions will always diffuse out. Active Transport • Active transport is required to move solutes against an osmotic concentration gradient – from a less concentrated to a more concentrated environment. • Requires membrane “pumps” and ATP. ….expensive BUT enables organisms to exploit otherwise uninhabitable niches. Principles…. • Water (H2O) is a small polarised molecule and will pass freely across a membrane. • Ion pumps cannot be used to pump water molecules! The pumps move the ions and water follows passively. • Water always flows down a concentration gradient and moves via osmosis. • Water moves from a solution with a low osmolarity to one with a higher osmolarity. • Osmolarity is the measure of the amount of solutes in a litre. Nitrogenous Waste Products • The elimination of nitrogenous waste products often coupled with water regulation therefore they are discussed together…. • Nitrogenous waste products (urea) cannot be eliminated without water. • Three main nitrogenous waste products produced by animals: ammonia (access to water essential), urea (must be eliminated in water) and uric acid (water not required for excretion). Nitrogenous Waste Products • Nitrogen is found primarily in proteins (amino acids). • Very important for creating new amino acids, and is a by-product following the catabolism of proteins. • Deamination creates NH4 + • Three mechanism: eliminate it, dilute it, or convert into less toxic alternative. Nitrogenous Waste Products • Marine and freshwater invertebrates and fish typically produce NH4+ • Can be eliminated quickly, cheap to produce and highly soluble in water. • Ammonotelic. Nitrogenous Waste Products • Terrestrial invertebrates are water limited – requirement to conserve water. • These organisms have to convert it into a less toxic alternative:  Urea: ureotelic animals includes mammals, amphibians, some reptiles and cartilaginous fish.  Uric acid: uricotelic animals includes terrestrial arthropods and snails, snakes, birds, many reptiles etc. Nitrogenous Waste Products • The process of deamination in vertebrates occurs in the liver. • Ornithine cycle. • Costly and requires water for elimination. • Urea excreted by the kidneys. Objectives of these lectures… • The main objectives of these lectures on osmoregulation and excretion are to provide you with knowledge on…  Terminology used with the literature and principles.  Strategies evolved in animals to regulate water/salt balance.  Invertebrate osmoregulatory organs.  Vertebrate osmoregulatory organs. Osmotic Strategies • Osmoconformers: animal conforms (wrt the blood/haemolymph etc.) to the osmotic concentration of its environment. • Osmoregulator: animal regulates its body fluids; keeps the osmotic concentration different to ambient (solute and solvent). • Some osmoconformers regulate the solutes – but maintains its osmotic concentration: ionic regulators. Osmotic Strategies  Marine: many are isotonic to their environment.  Freshwater: they are hypertonic to their environment.  Terrestrial: they are water limited.  Estuarine/intertidal: face changes in salinity: marine in origin • Osmoregulation/conformation is linked to habitat: INVERTEBRATES Inverts and verts Inverts and verts Invertebrates Marine Invertebrates (and brackish) Marine Invertebrates • Marine invertebrates are osmoconformers:  They conform their extracellular fluid.  They regulate their intracellular fluid. • K+, Na+ and Cl- are regulated by active transport – requires energy. • Brackish and intertidal invertebrates face daily fluctuations in the osmotic pressure of their body fluids. • For example: Mytilus edulis  They conform their extracellular fluid.  They regulate their intracellular fluid. Brackish/Intertidal Invertebrates • Use amino acids to help prevent changes in their intracellular fluid. Freshwater Invertebrates • Freshwater invertebrates are osmoregulators as their body fluids are hypertonic to their environment.  They regulate their extracellular fluid.  They regulate their intracellular fluid. Freshwater Invertebrates • They use their excretory system to regulate their extracellular fluids. • They produce lots of very dilute urine! • Daphina produces >200% body mass per day • There are some invertebrates that face different challenges to the “norm”. • They are hyper-hyposmotic regulators! Hyper-hyposomotic Invertebrates  Palaemonetes (salt marsh shrimp) is hyperosmotic in freshwater and hyposmotic in seawater.  Artemia (brine shrimp) hyposmotic in seawater. Can tolerate concentrations x3 greater than seawater! • They have to take up water (drink) and eliminate salts using salt glands; work by active transport.

Terrestrial Invertebrates  Impermeable integument: insects have an waxy epicuticle.  Live within moist environments: hygrophiles.  Water from food/drinking: fluid feeders.  Water from soil or air: spiders and mites.  Metabolic catabolism of sugar: C6H12O6 + 6O2  6CO2 + 6H2O Objectives of these lectures… • The main objectives of these lectures on osmoregulation and excretion are to provide you with knowledge on…  Terminology used with the literature and principles.  Strategies evolved in animals to regulate water/salt balance.  Invertebrate osmoregulatory organs.  Vertebrate osmoregulatory organs. • There are 4 main types of regulatory organs found in invertebrates:  Contractile vacuoles: protozoans and sponges.  Nephridial glands: platyhelminths  Antennal glands: crustaceans.  Malpighian tubules: insects. Osmoregulatory Organs in Inverts • Contractile vacuoles (CV) found in protozoans and sponges. Contractile Vacuoles • Cytoplasm is hyperosmotic wrt environment. • Vacuole is hyposmotic wrt cytoplasm. • Surrounded with mitochondria and vesicles. • Mitochondria provide energy and maintain the osmotic gradient. • Protonephridia are thought to be the earliest evolutionary type: flatworms, rotifers etc. Nephridia: Proto- and Meta- • Internal blind-ending tube network which connect to the environment via nephridophores. • Ends of the tubules is a cap cell. • Tubules are nephridoduc ts • Two types: Nephridia: Protonephridia  Flame cells – cap cell has several flagella.  Solenocytes - – cap cell has one flagellum.• The beating of the flagella draws extracellular fluid through the perforations. • Driven along the tubule and ions quickly reabsorbed. • Hyposmotic fluid “urine” collects in the ducts and is released. • Metanephridia more complex, common to annelids, molluscs etc. Nephridia: Metanephridia • Coelomic fluid passes into the collecting tubule. • Series of internalised tubules which terminate with the exterior: nephridiopore. • Ciliated funnel called nephrostome which open into the coelomic cavity. • Tubule long and has a bladder to store urine. Nephridia: Metanephridia • As the fluid passes along the tubules selective absorption of ions. • Fluid in the duct initially called: primary urine. • After selective absorption called: secondary urine. • Arthropods require different mechanism due to their open circulatory system. • Increase in complexity and reduction in the number required. • Aquatic crustaceans excrete NH4 + across their gills, and have antennal glands. • Terrestrial arthropods excrete mainly uric acid, urea etc. Arthropods • The closed end-sac leads to the labyrinth. • Nephridial canal leads to the bladder which connects to the environment via the nephropore. Arthropods: Antennal Glands • The end sac contains cells resembling podocytes. • Ultrafiltration of the haemolymph by pressure which forces smaller molecules into the sac. • Urine is modified in the labyrinth and the nephridial canal. Arthropods: Antennal Glands • Homarus (lobster):  Ultrafiltration, active secretion and active reabsorption of solutes.  Urine:blood concentration same. • Carcinus (estuarine crab):  Ultrafiltration and active reabsorption of solutes (including Na+) AND (passively) water.  Urine:blood concentration different. Arthropods: Antennal Glands • Antennal glands not the main nitrogenous waste excretory organ…. • Primary role to excrete solutes: Mg2+ and SO4 2- • Blind ending tubules which extend from the mid-gut. • K+ actively secreted into tubule, water follows passively. • Primary urine flows into the hind gut. Insects: Malpighian Tubules • In hind gut water reabsorbed through active reabsorption of solutes, and uric acid precipitates. • Precipitation facilitates withdrawal of more water from the hind gut. • Very effective at retaining water.

Osmoregulation and Excretion in Vertebrates Marine Vertebrates • Marine vertebrates can be divided into three main groups…. Marine Vertebrates  Blood is very similar in composition as the seawater: hagfish: osmoconformers.  Blood isosmotic but is ionically different : elasmobranchs, Rana, coelacanth etc. ionoregulators but osmoconformers.  Blood is approx. of seawater: teleosts etc. osmoregulators. Marine Vertebrates • The hagfish, Myxine, has slightly elevated Na + and Cl- levels in blood. • Lower levels of Mg2+, Ca2+, SO42- etc.  They (slightly!) regulate their extracellular fluid but they are classified as osmoconformers!  They regulate their intracellular fluid. Marine Vertebrates: Hagfish • The kidney removes the divalent ions in urine. Marine Vertebrates • Elasmobranchs have lower Na+ and Cl- levels in blood, BUT they are isosmotic.  They regulate their extracellular fluid “blood”. Marine Vertebrates: Elasmobranchs • They use organic osmolytes to “bridge the osmotic gap” including urea, trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) etc. • Kidneys reabsorb urea. • BUT they passively uptake Na+ and Cl- eliminated by rectal gland and kidneys (gills?). Marine Vertebrates • Teleosts have lower solute levels in blood; they are hyposmotic. • They constantly lose water and gain solutes: Na+ and Cl- . Marine Vertebrates: Teleosts • Drink seawater. • Two main osmoregulatory organs:  Gills: chloride cells Na+ and Cl- removed from blood (active transport).  Kidneys: remove divalent ions. Marine Vertebrates: TeleostsMarine VertebratesMarine Vertebrate Osmoregulatory Organs Hagfish Elasmobranchs etc. Teleosts Blood wrt environment Sodium and chloride blood levels Challenges (passive uptake) Solutions Marine Vertebrate Osmoregulatory Organs Hagfish Elasmobranchs etc. Teleosts Blood wrt environment Almost isotonic Almost isotonic Hypotonic Sodium and chloride blood levels Slightly higher. Lower (approx. of seawater), replaced with urea and TMAO. Very low (approx. of seawater) Challenges (passive uptake) Slight uptake of water. Elimination of Mg2+, SO4 2- and Ca2+ Uptake of Na+ and Cl- . Slight uptake of water. Uptake of Na+, Cl- and loss of water. Solutions Kidneys used to eliminate divalent ions (with water) Rectal gland and kidneys for Na+ and Cl- removal. Gills to remove Na+and Cl-; drinks seawater; kidney to eliminate divalent ions. Freshwater Vertebrates • Freshwater vertebrates all have higher solute concentrations in blood, and they are hyperosmotic. • They constantly gain water and lose solutes. Freshwater Vertebrates • Several solutions they have evolved:  Dilute urine.  Kidneys: reabsorb ions.  Active transport. Freshwater Teleosts • Teleosts have higher solute levels in blood; they are hyperosmotic. • They constantly gain water and lose solutes: Na+ and Cl- . • DO NOT drink water. • Two main osmoregulatory organs:  Gills: Na+ and Cl- actively taken up from environment (linked to CO2 elimination).  Kidneys: dilute urine. Freshwater TeleostsFreshwater Amphibians • Freshwater amphibians have higher solute levels in blood; they are hyperosmotic. • They constantly gain water and lose solutes: Na+ and Cl- . • DO NOT drink water. • Two main osmoregulatory organs:  Integument: Na+ and Cl- actively taken up from environment (linked to CO2 elimination).  Kidneys: dilute urine. Terrestrial Vertebrates Terrestrial Vertebrates • The main challenge terrestrial vertebrates face is… …water loss/conservation.  Thermoregulation: evaporative cooling.  Eliminating nitrogenous waste: urea.  Ventilation: exhalation in air breathers etc. • Dehydration through… Terrestrial Amphibians  Behavioural: reducing evaporative water loss.  Eliminating nitrogenous waste: uric acid.  Impermeable integument.  Reducing metabolic rate.  Water store: Ranoidea sp.  Sonoran desert toad: Incilius alvarius. • Conservation of water through… Terrestrial Reptiles  Dry scaly skin: reducing evaporative water loss.  Eliminating nitrogenous waste: uric acid • Conservation of water through… Terrestrial Mammals  Do not sweat or pant.  Very dry faeces.  Very concentrated urine.  Nocturnal and live within burrows, avoids daytime activity.  Nasal countercurrent exchange. • Kangaroo rat, Dipodomys merriami, is an excellent example of mammal adapted to very dry environments… • Minimise water loss through… • Majority of water obtained through metabolism. Vertebrate Kidney • The main osmoregulatory organ of terrestrial mammals is the kidney. • The ability of the kidney to concentrate urine is linked to the animals environment. • Concentrating ability of the kidney is related to the number of long looped (juxtamedullary) or short looped (cortical) nephrons.  Juxtamedullary – desert rodents etc.  Cortical – beavers and pigs. Vertebrate Kidney • Vasopressin (ADH) is released by the posterior pituitary, it controls the permeability of the collecting duct. • If absent dilute urine is formed. Vertebrate Kidney • Quick recap on the respective functions of the vertebrate kidney structures:  Glomeruli: ultrafiltration – removes water and the majority of compounds (exception of large proteins and blood cells) from blood.  Proximal Convoluted Tubule: selective reabsorption of water and other solutes, some active secretion.  Loop of Henle: reabsorbs water and salts. Important in water conservation.  Distal Convoluted Tubule: reabsorption of salts, Ca2+, and regulation of blood pH.
