Fossils and geological time Fossils Preserved plants and animals whose remains have been buried. • Soft parts decompose (or are eaten) • Hard parts (skeleton) must be quickly buried • Fossils are very rare Fossilisation – preserved remains By Anders L. Damgaard Fossilisation – Mineralization © 2014-2023 State Historical Society of North Dakota Fossilisation – replacement Fossilisation – Replacement – “Petrification” The process of turning some material (usually plant) into stone by infiltration with water carrying mineral particles without changing the original shape Borth petrified forest The dead wood becomes saturated with mineral-laden water. The porous nature of wood allows the movement of water-borne particles. A cross-section of unpetrified wood Petrified wood with crystals filling cavities Petrified wood in which the cell walls have degraded and have yet to be refilled with minerals Fossilisation – moulds and castsFossilisation – compression Dating a fossil: how old is it?
