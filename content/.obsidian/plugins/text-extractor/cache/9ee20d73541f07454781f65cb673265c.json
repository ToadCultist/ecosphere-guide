Uptake by the oceans There is a limit to the amount of CO2 that oceans can hold despite their large volumes Please source a definition of thermocline Brohan et al. 2006 Temperature has increasedFuture increase in temperature What happens in this Figure will depend on our activity in the future IPCC WGI Fifth Assessment Report (Chapter 12) Not all places with be affected the same In other words: • The poles will warm more than anywhere else • Dry places will become drier • Wet places will experience more precipitation IPCC WGI Fifth Assessment Report (Chapter 12) Scientists are more confident about temperature predictions than precipitation Effects on plants •Temperature and water availability will dictate their success and distribution in the future. •Niche requirements for a species will determine success or failure http://www.fs.fed.us/ne/delaware/biotrends Effects on Animals Eastern Phoebe Global Change has already resulted in some species evolving As the snow depth decreases there have been more brown individuals observed. Tawny Owl living in cold environments (Finland). Historically grey individuals were more predominant because they can hide better against snow in winter. Karell et al., 2011 Brown Grey Photosynthesis in 2050 • Higher CO2 concentrations in the air • Greater availability of CO2 generally results in an increased rate of photosynthesis www.ornl.gov FACE facility, Duke University Experimental studies (2050) Upper zone (Dry) Middle zone Lower zone (wet) Infre red warming Experiments suggest that warming will affect competitive interactions between species. It has been suggested that such experiments underestimate impacts Wolkovich et al., 2012 Effects on habitats - experimental • Decomposition faster under warmer and wetter conditions • Harvard Forest experiment used heating cables raise soil temperatures by 5oC • Results showed 60% increase in rates of soil respiration Indirect effectsChanges in habitat distribution Changing temperature and precipitation will alter the global spatial distribution of ecosystems www.usgcrp.gov Which species will be affected most by Global Change? Those that are too slow to move Loarie et al., 2009 The different speeds that species will have to move to find similar climates to present What if there is nowhere to go? For example montane species • There is nowhere to go! Gottfried et al., 2012 Rise in average temperature for European uplands • Flooding of low-lying wetlands and dry land areas • Erosion of shorelines – loss of sediments • Increased salinity of estuaries • Increased flooding and storm surges • Estuaries – changes in water depth, temperature, salinity and turbidity would affect ecology Effects on coastal ecosystemsClimate Change and Agriculture • Will be mix of benefits, disadvantages and risks. • Will vary depending where you are. Crops and temperature There is not a linear relationship beween crop yield and temperature Crop yield will fall at high temperatures especially if water availability is limited Schlenker W , and Roberts M J PNAS 2009;106:15594-15598 Change in primary production on agricultural land with Climate Change + elevated CO2 CO2 for photosynthesis could mean higher yield Gornall, et al., 2010 Effects on livestock Image: FreeDigitalPhotos.net Image courtesy of [graur razvan ionut] / FreeDigitalPhotos.net Thornton et al., 2009 a) Impacts on forage production b) High temperature stress will: •Reduce production •Reduce reproductive output •Increase mortality rate c) Reduce access to water availability d) Increase load of parasites and diseases Risk of wildfires • Risk for 2000-2100 compared to 1900-2000 Increase in risk Decrease in risk Gonzalez et al., 2010 Effects on human mortality Cairo, Egypt, 1982 Human health and heat Direct effects: • Increased heat stress • Asthma • Cardiovascular and respiratory ailments Indirect effects: • Increased incidence of communicable diseases • Increased mortality and injury (due to increased natural disasters) www.life.umd.edu Effects on humans • Insect-borne disease transmitted by female mosquito of the genus Anopheles • Anopheles has an optimum temperature for breeding (20-30oC) and at present 40% of the world’s population is at risk Human health - malaria www.aqua.org Summary • Global CO2 emissions increasing, causing changes in global carbon cycle, inc. rates of photosynthesis • Changes in CO2 have been linked to gradual increase in Earth’s temperature • Global patterns of temperature and precipitation will change dramatically over coming centuries • Distribution of species, habitats & ecosystems will be altered in future according to their differing tolerance of environmental conditions • Associated rise in sea level presents flooding risks • Increased temperature impacts on human health References and acknowledgements: • Beeby, A. & Brennan, A.M.
