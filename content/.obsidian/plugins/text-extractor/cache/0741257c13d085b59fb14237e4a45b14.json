The light-dependent reactions occur in the mesophyll cells, while the Calvin cycle occurs in the bundle sheath cells. 1 2 3 3 In bundle sheath CO2 released → Calvin cycle CO2 concentrated >5 in C4 bundle sheath so Calvin cycle can function efficiently The C4 pathway • 15,000 C4 species - many grasses, no trees • Warm, high light environments: savanna & steppe grasslands •  high photorespiration C4 plants: • 20-30% terrestrial CO2 fixation • 30% agricultural grain (esp. maize, sorghum, millet, etc.) C4 Plant Distributions 0-30% C4 30-60% C4 60-100% C4 • C4 v C3 seen in herbivore tooth enamel - 13C (heavy isotope, extra neutron, about 1% of natural carbon) • Enzymes discriminate: • Rubisco favors 12C • PEP carboxylase favors 13C • Convergent evolution: C4 photosynthesis has evolved independently at least 62 times during land plant evolution Rise of C4 Grasslands 5-8 mya Why did most abundant enzyme on Earth evolve inefficiently? • High CO2 & low O2 when plants colonize land • No need for high CO2 specificity for Rubisco?

Summary • Carbon fixation by ‘Rubisco’ called ‘C3’ • Stomata close → [CO2] falls → Rubisco reaction with O2 → carbon drain • Two pathways circumvent problem - o ‘CAM’ species: arid habitats, e.g. cacti o ‘C4’ species: up to 30% global carbon fixation • Inefficient evolution of Rubisco due to low [O2] of ancient Earth? • Ambitions to engineer C4 crops Image acknowledgments Pexels, https://www.pexels.com Campbell & Reece (2008) Biology, 8th edn.
