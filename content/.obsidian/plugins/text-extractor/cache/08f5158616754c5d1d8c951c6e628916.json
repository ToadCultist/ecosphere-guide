Tree terminology • Terminal node • Species or sequence for which data exists • Internal node • Hypothetical ancestor • Root • Hypothetical common ancestor • Of all nodes • Branch • Connects two nodes • Shows that one is the ancestor of the other • Branch length • Amount of evolution • Between two nodes Tree Resolution • Degree • Number of branches from an internal node • Polytomy • Node with more than three branches • More than 2 descendents and 1 ancestor • Fully resolved tree • Contains no polytomies Polytomies • Hard polytomy • All descendents evolved simultaneously • Soft polytomy • Order of divergence is unknown Shorthand for trees • Internal node • Pair of parentheses (brackets) • Encloses all descendents • Used by computer programs (A,B) ((A,B),C) (D,E) Tree types 1: Cladogram • Most basic tree • Relative recency of common ancestry • A and B • share a common ancestor • more recently than • A and C • B and C Tree types 2: Additive tree • Branch lengths • quantify evolutionary change • Sequence A • has acquired 4 substitutions • since common ancestor with sequence B • Sequence B • has acquired 1 substitution • since common ancestor with sequence A Types of tree 3: Ultrametric tree • Special kind of additive tree • Depicts evolutionary time • Tips of Branches • equidistant from the root • Time • Expressed directly • Years • Expressed indirectly • ‘sequence divergence’ • based on a molecular clock Horizontal and vertical axes • Cladograms • Both axes mean nothing • Additive trees • vertical axis • represents evolutionary change • Ultrametric trees • vertical axis • represents time Rooted and Unrooted Trees • Rooted tree • node identified as the root • all other nodes descend from root • Direction • Corresponds to evolutionary time Unrooted trees • No direction • Common ancestry • Determined by position of root Placement of root • Root • Can be placed on any branch • 7 rooted trees • From 1 unrooted tree Rooting trees • Root • Cannot be placed on the basis of phylogenetic data • Requires additional information • E.g. specification of outgroup Numbers of possible trees • Increases rapidly • With number of sequences • Finding the best tree • Very computationally intensive","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
