Gene amplified using PCR 2. Gene put into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector 3. Transformed her new plasmid into E. coli competent cells 4. Mixed results: blue and white colonies representing successful and unsuccessful clones of Tina’s gene 5. Problem: sample labels are missing – you need to identify which is which Aims of the experiment Three different ways to verify which strain has the successful clone: 1. Restriction digest: cutting the DNA, looking at the fragment sizes 2. PCR: amplification of the sequence of interest, look at the size of the amplified product 3. Transformation: growing the colonies to check if they are blue or white Obtain the DNA sequence from the successful clone and identify the cloned gene e.g. what species is it from? Image credit: Wikipedia Bacterial cell with plasmidThe pCR2.1-TOPO vector (plasmid) 1. Genes for kanamycin and ampicillin resistance 2. The enzyme β- galactosidase (lacZα), which breaks down galactose, producing a bright blue colour 3. A multiple cloning site Topo TA Cloing manual from Invitrogen, pg 23 shows the plasmid The plasmid with its genes Topo cloning site We have two types of plasmid 1. Ligation successful: Plasmid has the MSTN gene, the lacZα gene is broken 2. Ligation failed: Plasmid does not have the MSTN gene inserted at the cloning site, the lacZα gene is intact and functional Why do we have blue and white colonies? • If cloning is successful, the clones should be white, because the cloned gene disrupts the enzyme that breaks down X-gal • Unsuccessful clones should be blue, because the enzyme remains intact and therefore it breaks down X-gal into a blue compound Results: Understanding the gels We expect to see 4 products of different size in the gels 1. Restriction digest products • Product with the gene • Product without the gene 2. PCR amplification products • Product with the gene • Product without the gene The plasmid with its genes Topo cloning site Sequence around the cloning site, with restriction sites labelled Sequence around the cloning site, with PCR sites labelled Image credit: Wikipedia Intact plasmid Plasmid with insert – gene is disrupted There is a gene in plasmid that produces an enzyme. The enzyme reacts with agar to produce blue colour.

Gene in plasmid is disrupted by the inserted gene. It is not longer possible to produce the blue colour Cloning products: restriction PCR product runs between two Primer sites (approx 200 base pairs) PCR product runs between two Primer sites plus the inserted gene PCR primer site Cloning products: PCRRestriction and PCR productsSequence around the cloned gene, with PCR primers and restriction EcoRI sites labelled Cloned gene Identifying the gene • The sequence of the cloned gene can be determined, and then identified using online databases.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
