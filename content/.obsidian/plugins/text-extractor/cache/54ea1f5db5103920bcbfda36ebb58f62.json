Computer-based Practical 2 This session is the second computer-based practical session for BR17120 where we will reconstruct the phylogeny (evolutionary history) of the Aculeata (stinging wasps, bees and ants) using the Cytochrome C oxidase subunit I (COI) gene from the DNA of the Mitochondria of the following 7 species: Hylaeus communis Dipogon bifasciatus Dipogon subintermedius Ancistrocerus gazella Ancistrocerus trifasciatus Symmorphus crassicornis Symmorphus murarius Page 2 of 12 Step 1 Collecting the Data: We will be using the Barcode of Life database to get the DNA sequences for the species we are studying. DNA barcoding is a taxonomic method, that uses one or more standardized short genetic markers in an organism’s DNA to identify it as belonging to a particular species. Through this method unknown DNA samples can also be identified to registered species based on comparison to a reference library. One of the genes that are used for this is the Cytochrome C oxidase subunit I (COI) gene, which is a large transmembrane protein complex found in bacteria and the mitochondrion of eukaryotes. It is the last enzyme in the respiratory electron transport chain of mitochondria (or bacteria) located in the mitochondrial (or bacterial) membrane (Figure 1). Figure 1: The crystal structure of bovine cytochrome c oxidase in a phospholipid bilayer. The intermembrane space lies to top of the image. From:https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cytochrome_C_Oxidase_1OCC_in_Membrane_2.png Page 3 of 12 As is it present in every mitochondrion, and mitochondria are numerous in all eukaryotic cells, this makes it easy to isolate and sequence. Usefully, it also evolves at rate fast enough to allow difference in the DNA to exist between species, but slow enough to allow similarities between related species to also be identified. This makes it an excellent “barcode” gene and it is one of the main genes adopted by the international community for sequencing in all species. We will be retrieving the DNA sequence for the 7 species of Aculeata from the Barcode of Life database: http://www.boldsystems.org/ 1) Go to this page and click on the button labelled: EXPLORE THE DATA This will bring you to the following page, where you can search for the species (Figure 2): Figure 2: The main search page of the Barcode of Life database. Enter the species name as shown above and press \"search\" Page 4 of 12 This will bring you to the results page for this species. Note: If you get an error that there are no species matching the name, make sure you type it correctly. The results page will have a list of all specimens and data for that species, along with the GPS positions of where the species were collected (Figure 3). Figure 3: Results page for Hylaeus communis. Click on the ID one of the specimens which have “COI-5P” in the name (See the red arrow in Figure 3). TIP: try to pick one that has the largest number after the letters “COI-5P:”, this represents the length of the DNA that has been sequenced and we want this to be as long as possible. Page 5 of 12 This will bring you to a page that has all the information for this particular specimen (Figure 4). Figure 4: Specimen result page. You can get the DNA sequence for this species by clicking on the \"FASTA\" button. Click on the “FASTA” button and it will download a file called “Fasta.fas” which contains the DNA sequence. You can open this in a text editor or you can drag it onto a browser window and it will display the contents (Figure 5). Figure 5: The FASTA formatted DNA sequence for Page 6 of 12 Copy this DNA Sequence (with the name starting with a “>”) to a new text file, where you will gather all the DNA sequences to be analysed. Carry out these steps for all 7 species. You should end up with a text document containing the DNA sequences for all 7 species (Figure 6). To make things easier later you could replace all spaces “ “ in the names with underscores “_” or dashes “-“. Figure 6: Text file containing the DNA sequences of all 7 species Page 7 of 12 Step 2: DNA Alignment and phylogeny reconstruction. To build a phylogenetic tree, we need to be able to examine the homologous (same) DNA positions across species to identify if any changes have occurred. However, as some of our DNA sequences are of different lengths and we do not know what parts of the DNA sequences are missing we need to try to match the homologous DNA regions using a process called “DNA alignment” (Figure 7). We will use an online version of the “Muscle” DNA alignment Tool: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/muscle/ On the main page, copy/paste the DNA sequences for the 7 species together into the text box as shown in Figure 8 and choose the output format “FASTA”. Then click Submit at the bottom of the page to carry out the alignment. Before DNA Alignment: We may predict too many differences between these species. Species 1 ATGTCCTGTA Species 2 GTCCTGTAC After DNA Alignment: We can see that these two species have identical DNA sequences (except for some missing sections) Species 1 ATGTCCTGTA- Species 2 --GTCCTGTAC Figure 7: How DNA alignments work. Page 8 of 12 Figure 8: Carrying out the DNA sequences alignments using Muscle After a short amount of time, the results of your alignment will be displayed on the page (Figure 9). From the results page, click on the button: Phylogenetic Tree (Figure 9). Page 9 of 12 Figure 9: Results of the DNA alignment. Click the button indicated by the red arrow to build a phylogeny from the alignment. On the Next page, click “Submit”. This will eventually bring you to a results page, which will display the resulting tree. However, it will not have the correct root (Hyleaus communis), so in order to compare against the phylogenies from the first practical we need to “re-root” the tree. This just means indicating to a phylogeny visualisation software, which is the correct root to use. The phylogeny will then be “re- rooted”. Click on “Download Phylogenetic Tree Data” under your result to view the text version of the tree (Figure 10) and then save this file to your computer (using the “save as” option under the file menu). Page 10 of 12 Figure 10: Click on “Download Phylogenetic Tree Data” and then save the file on your computer (using “save as” under the File menu). We will use the online tree-viewer “iTOL” to re-root and generate an image of the final phylogenetic tree. Go to the website: http://itol.embl.de/upload.cgi Click “choose file” as indicated by the red arrow in Figure 11, and choose the file you saved in the previous step. Then click “Upload”. Page 11 of 12 Figure 11: Uploading a tree to iTOL. Click \"choose file\" and select the tree file from the previous step, then click \"upload\" This will bring you to a page that displays the resulting tree. Click on the outgroup “Hylaeus communis” and from the menus that appears, choose “tree structure” and “reroot tree here” (Figure 12). Figure 12: Rerooting the tree in iTOL. 1) Click on the name of the outgroup. 2) select \"tree structure\" from the menu that appears\" 3) click on \"Reroot tree here\". Page 12 of 12 This will result in the phylogeny being re-rooted correctly. Explore some of the settings in iTOL to try different ways of displaying the tree. Use the “Export” menu, indicated by the red circle in Figure 12 to generate a PNG formatted image of your resulting tree. Insert this tree into your final report. This tree has the same topology (shape) as one of the three trees from last week. Answer the following questions: a. Which of the three phylogenetic trees from the first practical matches the phylogeny that you reconstructed from the DNA sequences (from the second computer-based practical)? b. Which phenotypic characters required fewer evolutionary steps on the phylogenetic tree that you reconstructed from DNA (from the second computer-based practical) compared to the other trees? List these characters. c. Which phenotypic characters from the first practical required more evolutionary steps on the phylogenetic tree that you reconstructed from DNA (from the second computer-based practical) compared to the other trees? List these characters. d. Which types of characters (morphological, reproductive, ethological or ecological) match best with the phylogeny of the Aculeata reconstructed from DNA?","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":""}
