Linkage mapping • Linkage mapping relies upon recombination of genes during meiosis • Recombination is the process by which new combinations of parental characters arise in progeny • Eye colour: red (+) and white (w) • Wing length: normal (+) and miniature (m) • Sex-linked (on X chromosome) • Mutant alleles are recessive (only expressed in homozygous or hemizygous conditions) w m? How do we make a map? Need a population of flies in which our genes are segregating X Non-rec, parental Rec, non- parental How do we make a map? Need a population of flies in which our genes are segregating X Non-rec, parental Rec, non- parental How do we make a map? Need a population of flies in which our genes are segregating X Non-rec, parental Rec, non- parental How do we make a map? Then score the relative numbers of phenotypes in the F2 generation In the practical you score the numbers of: w m + + w + + m Parental/ non-recombinant Non-parental/ recombinant 769 2246 941 747 What is the recombination frequency between w & m? Round your answer to the nearest whole number and give your answer in centimorgans (cM) RF = no. recombinant flies x 100 total no. of flies RFwm = no. w + and + m flies x 100 total no. of flies w m? w m + + w + + m 769 2246 941 747 Constructing a linkage map RF = no. recombinant flies x 100 total no. of flies RFwm = no. w + and + m flies x 100 total no. of flies w m? w m + + w + + m 769 2246 941 747 = 941 + 747 x 100 = 35.9 cM 4703 Distance often expressed in centiMorgans 1% recombination = 1 cM = 1 map unit (m.u.) w m36 cM Fly map • A complete genetic map of the fly can be built up this way • Actual distance w – m = 36.1-1.5 = 34.5 cM Klug et al. (2012) Environmental effects on gene expression • The mutant allele cu causes the wings of the fruit fly to curl • Identified by T.H. Morgan in 1915 • This practical will test whether or not the expression of this gene is modulated by environmental conditions 12 How was the experiment set up?What did you do? • Classified flies as straight winged, semi-curled or curled for each temperature regime Straight Semi-curled Curled Straight Semi-curled Curled Total 20°C 4016 1878 538 6432 24°C 3931 4277 1585 9793 28°C 962 2429 3324 6715 Analysis of gene expression • It is not easy to see trends in the data • We have 2 ways of quantifying gene expression: • Penetrance • Expressivity Penetrance • The proportion of genotypes (cu/cu) that show the expected phenotype (curled wing) • Penetrance = no. affected flies (SC + C) x 100 total no. flies Calculate the penetrance of cu in flies reared at 20oC 4016 straight, 1878 semi-curled, 538 curled Penetrance = no. affected flies (SC + C) x 100 total no. flies Penetrance = 1878 + 538 x 100 6432 Penetrance = 37.6 Calculate the penetrance of cu in flies reared at 24oC, round your answer to one decimal place. 3931 straight, 4277 semi-curled, 1585 curled Penetrance = no. affected flies (SC + C) x 100 total no. flies Calculate the penetrance of cu in flies reared at 24oC 3931 straight, 4277 semi-curled, 1585 curled Penetrance = no. affected flies (SC + C) x 100 total no. flies Penetrance = 4277 + 1585 x 100 9793 Penetrance = 59.9 Calculate the penetrance of cu in flies reared at 28oC, round your answer to one decimal place. 962 straight, 2429 semi-curled, 3324 curled Penetrance = no. affected flies (SC + C) x 100 total no. flies Calculate the penetrance of cu in flies reared at 28oC 962 straight, 2429 semi-curled, 3324 curled Penetrance = no. affected flies (SC + C) x 100 total no. flies Penetrance = 2429 + 3324 x 100 6715 Penetrance = 85.7 Penetrance 20°C = 37.6 24°C = 59.9 28°C = 85.7 The proportion of genotypes (cu/cu) that show the expected phenotype (curled wing) Expressivity • The degree to which a particular genotype (cu/cu) is expressed in the phenotype • Expressivity = no. SC flies + 2(no. C flies) x 100 2(no. SC + C flies) • This is a weighted expression to reflect the degree of curledness Calculate the expressivity of cu in flies reared at 20oC 4016 straight, 1878 semi-curled, 538 curled Expressivity = no. SC flies + 2(no. C flies) x 100 2(no. SC + C flies) Expressivity = 1878 + 2(538) x 100 2(1878 + 538) Expressivity = 1878 + 1076 x 100 4832 Expressivity = 61.1 Calculate the expressivity of cu in flies reared at 24oC, round your answer to one decimal place. 3931 straight, 4277 semi-curled, 1585 curled Expressivity = no.
