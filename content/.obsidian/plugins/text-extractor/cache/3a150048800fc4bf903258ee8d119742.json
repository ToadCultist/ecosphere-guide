Genetic information in daughter cells is different from parent cell and different from each other Prokaryote cell division is by simple cell-splitting similar to mitosis Prokaryotes do NOT undergo meiosis Although some animals and plants reproduce asexually (which uses mitosis), most use sexual reproduction (meiosis) in some part of their life-cycle Meiosis is key for sexual reproduction because it halves the chromosome number in the gametes and generates genetic variation. Ploidy refers to the number of complete sets of chromosomes in the cell. Evans, Pyron & Wiens (2012) Polyploidy and Genome Evolution Most fungi and single celled organisms Most animals and plants Some plants and some algae Sexual life cycle Predominantly haploid Predominantly diploid Alternating The life cycle of this ferns and mosses uses both mitosis and meiosis to alternate between haploid and diploid structures The life cycle of a moss Is characterised by the ‘alternation of generations’ where the haploid state predominates. The haploid (n) ‘gametophyte’ (so called because it makes gametes) is what we normally see. Some stem tips are female and make eggs while others are male (and make sperm) all via mitosis. These fertilise to form the diploid ‘sporophyte’ (2n) which form spores (n) and repeat the cycle. Watch the YouTube video (from 2 min 10 sec) on the Bryophytes and alternation of generation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eN5ROvxpx8Q The life cycle of most animals means the multicellular, visible stages are diploid (or polyploid). The gamete (haploid stage) is largely hidden.

Meiosis: Diploid parent cell DNA replication in S phase Meiosis I halves the chromosome number Meiosis II maintains the chromosome number (similar to mitosis) and generates 4 daughter cells Mitosis: Diploid parent cell DNA replication in S phase Each daughter cell gets full complement of chromosomes    Meiosis Prophase I Chromosomes first become visible as thin threads. DNA replication is already complete. 1 Homologous chromosomes continue to condense and undergo synapsis (gene-for- gene pairing). 2 When synapsis is complete, each pair of homologous chromosomes forms a tetrad. Each chromosome consists of two sister chromatids. 3 Paternal homolog Centriole Nuclear envelope Chromosomes Microtubule Pair of homologous chromosomes Maternal homolog Sister chromatids Synapsis / Tetrad Non-sister chromatids Prophase I (cont.) The chromosomes continue to shorten and thicken and the chiasmata between non-sister chromatids become apparent. 4 The nuclear envelope begins to break down. 5 Prometaphase I and Metaphase I Metaphase I: Homologous pairs line up in random orientation down the equator of cell. 3 Prometaphase I: Spindles attach to kinetochores on chromosomes. 2 Anaphase I and Telophase I Anaphase I: Homologous chromosomes separate, but sister chromatids stay together 4 Telophase I and cytokinesis: Daughter cells are ready to move into prophase II. 5 Cells from meiosis I Meiosis II is equivalent to mitosis except the cells that come from meiosis I already possess half their normal chromosome number Meiosis II Prophase II: The nuclear envelope breaks down and the chromosomes condense. 1 Metaphase II: Chromosomes align in center of cell. 3 Cells from meiosis I Prometaphase II: Spindles attach to kinetochores on chromosomes. 2 Meiosis II (cont.) Anaphase II: Sister chromatids separate. 4 Telophase II and cytokinesis: The nuclear envelope re-forms and the cytoplasm divides. 5 Click on the play button at the bottom of the slide to start a short animation (with voice over) that describes the main changes that occur in meiosis (1 min 25 sec) Comparing Mitosis and Meiosis MEIOSIS I MITOSIS MEIOSIS II Parent cell (Diploid) Prophase I Metaphase I Anaphase I Telophase I Metaphase II Anaphase II Telophase II and Cytokinesis (cells are still haploid) Prophase IIProphase Metaphase Anaphase Telophase and Cytokinesis (Diploid) Prophase I Homologous chromosomes pair and exchange DNA Metaphase I and Anaphase I Homologous chromosomes are separated. Chromatids stay together Prophase II Cells are already haploid Meiosis IMitosis Key differences: Prophase Homologous chromosomes pair and form chiasma during the process called synapsis Metaphase Paired homologous chromosomes align on the equator of the cell Anaphase Homologous chromosomes are separated (sister chromatids stay together) Meiosis is a key source of genetic variation that drives evolution Segregation and independent assortment of homologous chromosomes Mixing of allelic DNA during chiasmata formation (crossing over) Crossing Over Homologous chromosomes Recombinant chromatids Synapsis (Tetrad formation) Chiasma during meiosis prophase 1 Sister chromatids Non-sister chromatids Paternal homolog Maternal homolog Maternal and paternal chromosomes are randomly distributed on either side of the cell plate. For each pair there is a 50/50 chance as to which side the homologs will go on. Maternal and paternal chromosomes are randomly distributed on either side of the metaphase plate. For each pair there is a 50/50 chance as to which side the homologs will go on. We have 23 pairs each with 50/50 probabilities. That works out to 223 possible combinations of gametes from one human individual. = 8,388,608. (Not including genetic variation generated from chiasma / crossing over or mutation) Good alignment Incorrect alignment One crossover product contains an insertion, the other a deletion Apart from the random assortment of chromosomes and the process of ‘crossing over’, there are also other sources of genetic variation during meiosis. Eg. If homologous chromosomes misalign during prophase 1.. It can result in unequal swapping of DNA Insertions or deletions a. Female b. Male Oocyte Sperm cells Non-functioning Polar cells Meiosis in mammalian gamete formation Differences between Male v female Mitosis is how eukaryote somatic cells divide. Sex cells (gametes) are the result of meiosis. Now you have seen the process of mitosis, what differences between that and meiosis do you know? Mitosis • Involves one cell division • Results in two daughter cells • Results in diploid daughter cells (chromosome number remains the same as parent cell) • Daughter cells are genetically identical • Occurs in all organisms except viruses • Creates all body cells (somatic) apart from the germ cells (eggs and sperm) • Prophase is much shorter • No recombination/crossing over occurs in prophase. • In metaphase individual chromosomes (pairs of chromatids) line up along the equator. • During anaphase the sister chromatids are separated to opposite poles. Meiosis • Involves two successive cell divisions • Results in four daughter cells • Results in haploid daughter cells (chromosome number is halved from the parent cell) • Daughter cells are genetically different • Occurs only in animals, plants and fungi • Creates germ cells (eggs and sperm) only • Prophase I takes much longer • Involves recombination/crossing over of chromosomes in prophase I • In metaphase I pairs of chromosomes line up along the equator. • During anaphase I the sister chromatids move together to the same pole. • During anaphase II the sister chromatids are separated to opposite poles. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMEyeKQClqI Watch the video (5 min 32 sec) to remind you of the different stages of meiosis and the cellular changes that occur in each stage.","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":""}
