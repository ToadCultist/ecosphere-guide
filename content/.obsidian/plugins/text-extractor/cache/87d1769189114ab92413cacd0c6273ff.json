Rothschild (2004) J. Eukaryotic Microbiol. chloroplast Primary host cell mitochondrion Primary host cell nucleus cyanobacterium Green alga Primary host α-proteobacterium? 1° Endosymbiosis • Modern day photosynthetic organisms all evolved from the endosymbiosis of one ancestral cyanobacterium. • Primary endosymbiotic event: green algal clade. Chlorophytes • Embryophyta (terrestrial plants) evolved from the class Charophycea. • They share common characteristics with land plants including:  Cellulose cell walls.  Starch synthesis and storage in the stroma of the chloroplast.  Chl b, lutein and ß carotene.  Granal stacks.  Two membranes around their chloroplasts. Chlorophytes • Gametes are produced via mitosis. • Alternation of generations. • Multicellular haploid gametophyte and multicellular diploid sporophyte: diplobiontic. Plant Lineage • The green algae gave rise to land plants… • 3 clades of green algae: chlorophytes, coleochaetophytes and stoneworts. • Stoneworts also called Charales. Plant Lineage • Land plants are collectively called: Embryophytes. • 3 non-vascular extant lineages (bryophytes): liverworts, mosses and hornworts. • They are all found in association with water. • They lack vascular elements, remained small, liverworts lack stomata, lack leaves, retain and protect their embryo. Plant Lineages…Plant Lineage: Liverworts • Liverworts (Marchantiophyta):  ~ 9,000 species.  Very thin, ribbon like thallus.  Gametophyte is dominant.  Sporophyte remains attached and releases the spores.  Water is required for sperm to reach the archegonium. Plant Lineage: Mosses • Mosses:  ~ 12,000 species.  Small and grow in damp habitats.  Absorb nutrients across their “leaves”.  Gametophyte is dominant and produces the sperm/eggs.  Embryo retained and releases the spores. Plant Lineage: Hornworts • Hornworts:  100-150 species only.  Flattened thallus.  Cells only have one chloroplast.  Gametophyte is the dominant stage.  Sporophyte retained and acquired nutrients from gametophye via the foot. Plant Lineages…Plant Lineage: Lychophytes • Lychophytes:  ~ 1,300 species.  Oldest living vascular plants (~ 425 Ma Silurian).  Dominated the Carboniferous.  Sporophyte is the dominant stage.  Microphylls. Plant Lineages…Plant Lineage: Euphyllophytes • Euphyllophytes:  Sister group to the clubmosses and includes the ferns (Polypodiophyta), Psilophyton spp. (extinct), gymnosperms and angiosperms evolved.  Horsetails (Equisetidae) are a subclass of the Polypodiophyta (ferns).  Macrophylls. Plant Lineage: Euphyllophytes • Horsetails (Equisetum): • Ferns (Polypodiophyta)  10,500 spp.  Fossils from ~ 360 Ma (late Devonian).  They produce spores.  Sporophyte dominant.  15 spp.  Fossils from ~ 200 Ma (early Jurassic).  True leaves (reduced) and roots.  Sporophyte is dominant.  Produce spores. Plant Lineage: Spermatophyta • Spermatophyta  Includes the gymnosperms and angiosperms (seed plants).  Early seed producing taxa: pteridosperms (fern like leaves that produce seeds) and cordaites (extinct) (early Carboniferous 360 Ma) .  Angiosperms thought to have arisen from the seed fern lineage (Caytoniales) and not the gymnosperm clade. Microbial and Plant Diversity: Back to the beginning…. Evolutionary History • Grypania is the oldest unicellular green alga known.  Dates from 1870 Ma in the Proterozoic. • Bangia is the oldest filamentous red alga.  Dates from 1200 Ma. • Cladophora is the oldest multicellular green alga.  Dates from 800-700 Ma. Terrestrial Invasion! • Evidence of land colonisation by mid-Ordovician (470 Ma). • BUT….land initially was very hostile to life several significant events occurred prior to this….  Intense tectonic activity resulted in the formation of Pangea.  Mantle upwelling and melting increased sea levels causing widespread flooding.  Three glaciation events: Sturtian, Marinoan and Edicarian.  At the end of the Ordovician another glaciation event with the Late Ordovician Mass Extinction (LOME). Soil Formation • Early land would have been bare rock with no available minerals. • Was colonised by cyanobacteria, non PS bacteria and eukaryotes. • Palaeo-soils forming 2700 Ma. by 440 Ma soils were established. • Soil formed by two processes:  Weathering by acid rain.  Organic acids produced by bacteria. Soil Formation • Inorganic N present but needs to be converted into biologically available forms. • Through lightening and N2 fixation. • N2 fixation by anoxygenic PS prokaryotes. • Lichens (found in fossils dated to 551-635 Ma).  Occupy and can weather bare rock.  Contain N2 fixing bacteria. • Microbes secrete organic acids which break down and release minerals: Fe and P. • Siderophores: iron chelating molecules that allow microbes to take up iron (Fe3+). • Produced in response to an iron deficiency. • Taken up by other microbes and then Fe is released when they die. Other significant changes that occurred to allow green algae to invade the land…. Soil Formation • Climate conditions very different to today: • Cooling throughout the Ordovician resulting in a glaciation event (~ 460 Ma). Climatic Conditions  High levels of CO2 (0.32-1.4% higher) and low levels of O2 (4% rather than 20%).  Ozone thinner.  Solar radiation much less.  Surface temperatures of ≈ 21ºC Chlorophyte Life Cycle • Over their evolution they became haplobiontic. • Multicellular sporophyte and no multicellular gametophyte. • Alternation of generations. • Having a diplobiontic life cycles provides advantages because there is flexibility to evolve…. Developmental Specialisation  The gametophyte is water dependent, but the sporophyte can invade the terrestrial environment.  Sporophyte produces thousands of spores. • Mosses, liverworts and hornworts are all reliant on water for their gametophyte stage. • Resistance to desiccation was a significant first step to terrestrial life…. Desiccation  Sporopollenin (polymer) in the spore: resistant to desiccation, provides structural rigidity and protection against UV.  Cuticle (lipid polymers) in all terrestrial structures: provides resistance from microbial attack and abrasion.  Stomata: none, then a few (<5 mm-2 to >50-1000 mm-2) due to high atmospheric CO2 levels. • Aquatic plants have no requirement for structural support or conducting elements. • Hollow (dead) cells with strong cell walls. Water and Nutrient Uptake  G type cell wall – annular reticular thickenings.  S type cell wall – helical thickenings.  P type cell wall – scalariform pittings. • Increased capacity to conduct water and reduced energy requirements. • High O2 levels. • Three tracheid types: • To grow in hight a stem is required. • Stem must maintain flexural rigidity: thick walled and wide. Mechanical Support ✘ Problem: strengthening material has to be under the surface.  Solution: strengthening material were hydrostatic cells. • Hydrostatic cells (parenchyma) optimal location in at the centre of the stem. • BUT…. gain height (> 2 cm) these cells were not sufficient. Mechanical Support  Solution: mechanical tissue (collenchyma) located on the periphery of the stem. ✘ Problem: light penetration. • ”Roots” first appear in the fossil record ~ 408 Ma. Anchorage • Little specialisation: lacked a root cap or epidermis. • Evolved as the result of the main stem being covered in mud. • First “plants” found ~ 430 - 420 Ma late Silurian/early Devonian). First Plants…  Cooksonia: 6 cm, leafless dichotomously branched with sporangia.  Aglaophyton major: 20 cm, horizontal rhizome, cuticle and stomata.  Rhynia gwynne-vaughanii: 18 cm, horizontal rhizome, dichotomously branched, S type tracheids. • First “plants” found ~ 430 - 420 Ma late Silurian/early Devonian). First Plants…  Zosterophyllum divaricatum: 30 cm, sporangia on stem, H type branching, G type tracheids.  Baragwanathia longifolia: 1 m, rhizotomous, long slender leaves, G type tracheids.  Psilophyton dawsonii: 60 cm, highly evolved tracheids, dichotomous branches with sporangia. • Between ~ 470 (middle Ordovician) to ~ 400 (early Devonian) significant land changes: The Impact of Land Colonisation…  Channelling of rivers.  Stable river banks.  Muddy floodplains.  Soil formation.  Ordovician glaciation due to weathering of rocks. • Between ~ 394 (middle Devonian) to ~ 299 (end Carboniferous) there was significant global changes. • Climate changed from warm and humid with high CO2 to cold and arid with high O2. Mid Devonian to end Carboniferous…  Extensive tectonic activity.  High precipitation at the equator.  Significant creation of C stores: mineral and biological. • Peak in the number of plant species ~ 360 Ma then a decline. • Between ~ 394 (middle Devonian) to ~ 299 (end Carboniferous) significant morphological adaptions evolved to life on land…  to increase in height…. Further Adaptations to Land…  to optimise photosynthesis…  to eliminate the reliance on water for reproduction… • As plants became taller the vascular elements became more complex:  Protostele (~ 420 Ma): central xylem surrounded with phloem.  Siphonostele (~ 420 Ma):central pith surrounded with xylem and then phloem.  Eustele (~ 420 Ma): many strands of xylem and phloem. Increase in height… • Evolution of leaves – the compartmentalisation of photosynthesis was required due to the evolution of secondary xylem and phloem - wood.  Microphylls: small leaf. Evolved from spines from the main stem and contain one vascular element. In plants with protosteles. Optimisation of Photosynthesis…  Macrophylls: large leaf. Evolved from webbing forming between branches. In plants with siphono- or eustele. • Mutation resulting in the formation of two types of spore (heterospory): Reproduction…  Megaspore: the ancestral ovule.  Microspore: the ancestral pollen. • Megaspore was retained an encapsulated within a coat. • Opening (micropyle) at the top of the seed coat to allow entry. • Evolution of pre-pollen and true pollen. First Tree…!! • Gilboa tree (Pseudosprochnus) existed 385 Ma in mid Devonian. • Had leafless photosynthetic branches which were shed. • Found in water logged low oxygen soils. • Went extinct in late Devonian. • Early Carboniferous (~ 360 Ma) evolution of… The Evolution of…  Sphenopsids: horsetails.  Lycopsids: club mosses.  Filicopsids: ferns.  Progymnosperms: extinct, gave rise to the gymnosperms.  Cordaites: extinct gymnosperms.  Pteridosperms: extinct seed ferns. • During the Permian saw the evolution of the following groups: Permian to Triassic  Bennittitales: bennettites – extinct seed plants.  Glossopteridaceae: glossopterids – extinct seed plants.  Gnetales: extant gymnosperm, seed plants.  Cycadales: cycads – extant gymnosperms, seed plants.  Ginkgoales: ginkgos – extant gymnosperm, seed plants. • Significant radiation of the seed plants. • The formation of Pangea resulted in the change to warm and humid climate. • Increase in CO2 levels from ~ 300 ppm to 1500 ppm. Permian to Triassic • Evolution of conifers (sister group to the Cordaites). • The evolution of the Caytoniales (extinct) – ultimately gave rise to the angiosperms. • First definitive evidence 139 Ma (lower Cretaceous) – possibly 140 Ma earlier?? • Thought to be herbaceous and small or aquatic. Angiosperms - the late arrivers! • Evolved at lower warmer latitudes and spread to higher (colder) latitudes. • What drove their rapid diversification?  The environment  Dinosaurs??  Insects… • Climate change and increase tectonic activity – period of warmth at the time of rapid angiosperm speciation. • Super plume events resulting in: Diversification of Angiosperms  Increased global temperatures.  Increased sea level rise.  Fluctuating [CO2] : ~ 300 ppm to 1500 ppm. • Co-evolution of angiosperms alongside insects. • Early angiosperms were insect pollinated (zoophily) evidenced by sticky pollen. • Accelerated evolution through: Diversification of Angiosperms  Greater dispersal.  Increased genetic diversity.
