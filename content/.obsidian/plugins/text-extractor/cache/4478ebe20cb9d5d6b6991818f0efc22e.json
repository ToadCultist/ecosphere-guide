Scan for the first ‘start’ codon M Stop Start reading off the codons in frame with the AUG Until you find an in-frame stop codon Note: You may find internal Methionine, that’s OK. Also, ignore any out-of-frame stop codons. 2 Arg 3 Ser 4 Met 5 Asn 6 Tyr 7 Arg 8 Gln 9 Pro 5’ 3’ 64 possible codons AUG (Met) universal start codon Met and Trp Which AAs have only one codon? How many stop codons are there? Three Which AAs have six codons? Leu, Ser & Arg Which position on the codon is most variable? 3’ end Messenger RNA (mRNA) Initiation factors Elongation factors Release factors Aminoacyl tRNA synthetases Transfer RNA (tRNA) Ribosome (ribosomal RNA + ribosomal proteins) The various cellular parts needed for Eukaryote translation are: E P A Exit site Aminoacyl (Acceptor) site Peptidyl site The large subunit includes three binding sites for tRNAs. Large subunit Small subunit The Eukaryote ribosome complex is composed of two subunits In Eukaryotes, the large subunit is also called the 60S subunit and the small one is the 40S subunit. (Although the total is 80S) The S values refers to its Svedberg (or sedimentation) rate when centrifuged Large subunit has three sites for tRNA binding Initiation of translation Initiation factors help small SU of ribosome locate the 5’ cap of the mRNA Ribosome is composed of two subunits First the small SU binds Met-tRNA and locates the AUG codon Then large SU joins and starts process of elongation Small subunit Large subunit Ribosome Eukaryote Initiation Factors bind to mRNA cap Ribosomal small subunit plus Met-tRNA link to form the Initiation Complex eIFs are lost and Initiation Complex scans in 3’ direction to find first AUG codon. Brings large subunit to start elongation Initiation E P A When the complex reaches an AUG, the large ribosomal subunit joins, the initiation factors are released, and a tRNA complementary to the next codon binds to the A site. Initiation A reaction releases the Met from its tRNA and transfers it to the new amino acid on the tRNA in the A site, (the valine) forming a peptide bond. Initiation - Elongation The ribosome moves down one codon, which puts the tRNA carrying the polypeptide into the P site and the now- uncharged tRNA into the E site, where it is ejected. A new tRNA complementary to the next codon binds to the A site. Elongation The ribosome complex moves along the mRNA one codon in the 3’ direction adding new charged tRNAs into the A site, shuffling the ones in the P site onto the E site and discharging empty tRNAs from the E site. Each time a new amino acid to joined to the growing peptide chain The polypeptide transfers to the amino acid on the tRNA in the A site. The polypeptide is elongated by repeating steps (d) and (e). The ribosome moves down one codon, which puts the amino acid carrying the polypeptide into the P site and the now- uncharged tRNA into the E site, where it is ejected. A new tRNA complementary to the next codon binds to the A site. Elongation factors cycle the charged tRNAs into the ribosome. This process requires energy. Termination When the ribosome reaches an in-frame stop codon, a special uncharged tRNA called a release factor binds at the A site and terminates amino acid extension To see a summary of the processes of translation. Watch the video (3 min 30 sec) Identify the three main stages: Initiation, Elongation & Termination https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bLEDd-PSTQ Primary: sequence order of amino acids in a polypeptide chain. Secondary: depending on the chemistry of the amino acids, two common secondary structures are helices and sheets. Tertiary: describes the folding and coiling of the helices and sheets to form a final polypeptide shape. Quaternary: some proteins are made of more than one amino acid chain. Combination of different polypeptide subunits. Protein StructureTertiary Structure Space-filling model: shows the shape and contour of the folded protein Ribbon model: emphasizes the alpha helices and the beta sheets Ball-and-stick model: shows the atoms in the amino acid chain Quaternary Structure Interaction between tertiary structures of separate amino acid chains Eg.

E.g. Phosphorylation is highly effective for controlling enzyme activity. Glycosylation can promote protein folding and improve stability.

What could possibly go wrong? Looking for 2/3 or 3/4 of the poster material to cover the processes that enable protein function to be determined by DNA structure. What could possibly go wrong? Mutations in the DNA sequence. Spontaneous / inherited? Type of mutations? SNP-like (substitutions/ additions or deletions) or chromosomal scale (major loss, duplication or inversion)? Examples?
