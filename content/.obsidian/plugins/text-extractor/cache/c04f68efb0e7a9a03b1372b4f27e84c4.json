What organism is it from? Using bioinformatics tools with the DNA sequence Search DNA and protein databases with BLAST (pairwise alignments) https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ BLASTN and BLASTX are relevant tools to use How to identify what gene the sequence is? • Compare the gene sequence against databases of “known” genes to find the gene it is most similar to • BLAST software is used to do this • Blastn for a DNA against DNA search • Blastx for a DNA against proteins search Use alignment between pairs of sequences as the bases of gene comparison Known sequence Unknown sequence Gaps in the alignment Mismatch between sequences Search databases to find the most similar sequence i.e. the sequence that aligns with the fewest gaps and mismatches BLASTN results: nucleotide against nucleotide Hits to bacterial chromosomes adjacent to hits from cloning vectors BLAST scores and statistics Sequence comparison is reported using the following: • Total score • Query coverage • E-value (similar to p-value, a score of how likely the similarity between sequences would be, according to chance) • Percentage identity Database search has given lots of info on the sequence, but we still don’t know what gene it is. Try a different form of BLAST: • Genes translate as proteins • Proteins are functional • BLASTX: translates the DNA sequence into protein, and then searches databases of protein sequence","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
