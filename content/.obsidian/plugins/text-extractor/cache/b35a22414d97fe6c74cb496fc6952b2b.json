What would you predict in such an experiment? Some plants produce procenes, which block JH production, as a defense. Why is that effective? Endocrine system (2) • Neuroendocrine control of growth and development in insects • Pineal gland and suprachiasmatic nucleus of vertebrates • Pituitary gland of vertebrates: the master gland Suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) located in hypothalamus Receives sensory info from eyes and acts as pacemaker Surgical removal of SCN = loss of circadian rhythm Transplant of SCN between wild type and tau-mutant hamsters modifies circadian rhythm Suprachiasmatic nucleus Pineal gland Once thought to be a valve regulating the ‘flow of knowledge’… then thought to be a vestigial structure… Secretes melatonin under control of SCN Short day breeders (e.g. deer) cue on increases in melatonin Long day breeders (e.g. birds) cue on decreases Pineal gland is directly photosensitive in fish, reptiles, birds, amphibians Pinealocytes in these animals are modified rod-type photoreceptors Comparative aspectsEndocrine system (2) • Neuroendocrine control of growth and development in insects • Pineal gland and suprachiasmatic nulceus • Pituitary gland: the master gland The master gland Posterior pituitary (neurohypophysis) is an extension of the hypothalamus Anterior pituitary (adenohypophysis) develops from a fold of tissue in embryonic mouth Pituitary gland Posterior pituitary Anterior pituitary Neurosecretory cells of the hypothalamus Hypothalamus Axon HORMONE OxytocinADH Kidney tubulesTARGET Mammary glands, uterine muscles Posterior pituitary = axons and terminals of ~10,000 hypothalamic neurosecretory cells Oxytocin enhances contraction of smooth muscle in uterine wall during delivery; Stimulates milk letdown from mammary glands in response to suckling Anti-diuretic hormone(vasopressin) increases water reabsorption from urine in response to dehydration Fig. 45-17 Hypothalamic releasing and inhibiting hormones Neurosecretory cells of the hypothalamus HORMONE TARGET Posterior pituitary Portal vessels Endocrine cells of the anterior pituitary Pituitary hormones Tropic effects only: FSH LH TSH ACTH Nontropic effects only: Prolactin MSH Nontropic and tropic effects: GH Testes or ovaries Thyroid FSH and LH TSH Adrenal cortex Mammary glands ACTH Prolactin MSH GH Melanocytes Liver, bones, other tissues Anterior pituitaryControl of the anterior pituitary Hypothalamus secretes releasing hormones and inhibiting hormones Secreted into hypophyseal portal system Anterior pituitary secretes its own hormones in response (into general circulation) Anterior pituitary hormones Corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) Controls cortex of adrenal gland (cortisol – stress responses) GHRH and GHIH Human growth hormone (hGH) Controls liver (IGFs – protein synthesis, lipid metabolism, glucose release) Thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) Controls thyroid gland (T3, T4 – regulate metabolism and BMR) PIH, PRH Prolactin (PRL) Initiates and maintains milk secretion by mammary glands Anterior pituitary hormones Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) Males - Stimulates sperm development Females - Controls follicle development (secretion of estradiol) Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) Luteinizing hormone (LH) Males - Stimulates testosterone secretion Females - Triggers ovulation & CL formation Anterior pituitary hormones In jawless fish, amphibians, reptiles, most mammals, anterior pituitary includes a well defined intermediate lobe Absent in birds, cetaceans, and rudimentary in humans after birth Anterior, posterior, …and intermediate lobes Secretes MSH(s), under inhibitory control of dopamine from hypothalamus α-MSH controls skin coloration via dispersion of melanin granules in melanocytes [Small amounts in humans: regulates food intake and excitability of nervous system.] Figure 7-13 Don’t get confused! This diagram still shows the anterior pituitary; the diagram is oriented the opposite way to some of the previous ones you’ve seen Endocrine system (2) • Neuroendocrine control of growth and development in insects • Pineal gland and suprachiasmatic nucleus of vertebrates • Pituitary gland of vertebrates: the master gland","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
