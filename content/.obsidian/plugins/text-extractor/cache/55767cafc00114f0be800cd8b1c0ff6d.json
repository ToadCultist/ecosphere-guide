Food is catabolised to produce ATPATP hydrolysis is an exergonic reaction • Different bonds contain different amounts of energy Cells harness energy for metabolism • Catabolic reactions result in a net release of energy (negative ΔG), often captured as ATP. • Anabolic reactions require input of energy (positive ΔG), often in the form of ATP. • Hydrolysis of ATP releases energy which the cell can use for metabolism or to do work. • Respiration (catabolism) usually requires oxygen (aerobic) but some organisms respire anaerobically. • Catabolism is oxidative. Redox Changes in the oxidation state of molecules Reduction = gain of electrons Oxidation = loss of electrons Redox = Reduction – Oxidation reactions - Electrons are transferred from one molecule to another (1 loses, 1 gains) - Red and Ox reactions always occurs together in a single redox reaction. When electrons are gained - the oxidation state decreases When electrons are lost - the oxidation state increases Na + Cl => NaCl Sodium chloride e- Na (+) Cl (-) (Oxidised) (Reduced) Redox Changes in the oxidation state of molecules Reduction = loss of oxygen Oxidation = gain of oxygen Oxygen is very electronegative Oxygen gains 2 electrons (reduced) Hydrogens lose 1 electron each (oxidised) O2 + 4H => 2H2O Redox Changes in the oxidation state of molecules Reduction = gain of electrons or loss of oxygen Oxidation = loss of electrons or gain of oxygen Hydrogen nuclei (protons) follow electrons Reduction is gain of electrons (and H) Oxidation is loss of electrons (and H) Reduction = gain of electrons, gain of H or loss of oxygen Oxidation = loss of electrons, loss of H or gain of oxygen Catabolism Proline => hydroxyproline Photosynthesis: 6CO2 + 6H2O => C6H1206 + 602 Fe 3+ + e - => Fe2+ Respiration of glucose: C6H1206 + 602 => 6CO2 + 6H2O Which is more oxidised, ribose or deoxyribose ? Which is more oxidised, NAD or NADH ? Which is more oxidised, C-H or C-O-H ? Which is more oxidised, O=C=O or CH2-O-H ? Which is more oxidised, palmitate (C16 fatty acid) or glucose? Are these processes reductive or oxidative? Oxygen - Gains electrons = electron acceptor - Oxidises glucose = oxidising agent Glucose - Loses electrons = electron donor - Reduces oxygen = reducing agent Respiration of glucose: C6H1206 + 602 => 6CO2 + 6H2ORespiration Catabolism is oxidising, removing H and adding O Therefore the more H and less O, the greater the amount a molecule can be catabolised Sugars: CH20 H:O = 2:1 Ethanol: C2H6O H:O = 6:1 Fats: CH3(CH2)14CO2H H:O = 16:1 • The release of energy has to be controlled. Otherwise it would be like throwing a gummy bear into a beaker of molten perchlorite. • The rate of energy release is controlled by a series of metabolic pathways in aerobic and anaerobic respiration. • The controlled release of energy allows the chemical energy to be moved from the bonds of fuel molecules (e.g. C-C bonds of glucose) to the bonds of useful molecules like ATP. RespirationAerobicRespiration Storage Muscle (Quick access) Liver (Central store) Glycogen (animals) Starch (plants) Granules (inside plant cells) Excess glucose Glucose • In times of plenty, glucose is stored as chains of sugars • When needed for energy, they are broken down, back into glucose. • Blood glucose levels are very tightly regulated • When ATP is low, glucose is catabolised. • When ATP is high, glucose is stored. • The fate of glucose is regulated by the activity of enzymes in the pathways of respiration. Electron Carriers • Two nucleotides, which can each accept and donate electrons. • Redox reactions: (oxidised) NAD + + 2e- + H + <==> NADH (reduced) (oxidised) FAD + 2e- + 2H + <==> FADH2 (reduced) Respiration Important in evolution of life on earth – when there was no atmospheric O2 AnaerobicKey messages • Cellular respiration is the process by which fuel molecules (e.g. glucose) are converted to the cellular energy molecule ATP. • Cellular respiration is a series of catabolic redox reactions • Excess glucose is stored as glycogen in the muscle and liver in animals, and as starch in plants. • The release of energy has to be controlled, and therefore cellular respiration happens in key stages which can broadly be classified as aerobic or anaerobic.
