How do chemical synapses work? How do excitatory and inhibitory chemical synapses work? What is temporal and spatial summation, and how does it apply here? 4 Consolidation 1: Botulism • Botulinum toxin • Produced by Clostridium botulinum • Common in soil. Spores germinate in moist, low oxygen environments like animal carcasses, rotting organic material, poorly prepared silage • Cattle can take in toxin via bone chewing, contaminated/spoiled feed = BOTULISM 5 Consolidation 1: Botulism • https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBYQ01gV58A • Some clinical signs: • Collapse, muscular weakness, paralysis • Stumbling walk • Flaccid paralysis of hindlegs • Paralysis of face, jaw, tongue • Paralysis of eyelids 6 Consolidation 1: Botulism Enters motor neuron terminals by endocytosis Cleaves proteins that enable exocytosis of synaptic vesicles (ACh) What happens? 7 “Botox” treatment 8 Consolidation 2: Tetanus • Reasonably common in livestock • Caused by tetanospasmin (tetanus neurotoxin) produced by Clostridium tetani • Bacteria enter wounds or damaged tissue and produce toxin 9 Consolidation 2: Tetanus • Stiffness, reluctance to move • Lockjaw • Unsteady gait, stiff tail • Muscle spasm • Lying on side, legs stiff 10 Consolidation 2: Tetanus Enters motor neuron terminals by endocytosis Transcytosis into inhibitory interneurons Cleaves proteins that enable exocytosis of synaptic vesicles (GABA/glycine) What happens? 12 Fig. 50-29b Ca2+ ATPase pump Synaptic terminal of motor neuron Synaptic cleft T Tubule Plasma membrane Ca2+ Ca2+ CYTOSOL SR ATP ADP P i ACh Recalling concepts 2: muscle contraction How does muscle contraction work? What are the roles of Ca2+ ions in the process (hint: >1!)? 13 Fig. 50-29b Ca2+ ATPase pump Synaptic terminal of motor neuron Synaptic cleft T Tubule Plasma membrane Ca2+ Ca2+ CYTOSOL SR ATP ADP P i ACh Consolidation 3: parturient paresis (‘milk fever’) 14 Parturient paresis (‘Milk fever’) • https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeT9j T7KeGs • Hypocalcemia (↓Ca) • Muscle weakness (paresis) • How can we explain this? Recalling concepts 3: resting potentials and action potentials Why can we measure a voltage across the membrane of a neuron? What are graded/action potentials? What kinds of ion channels cause them? How does a graded potential cause an action potential? V 17 Consolidation 4: Hypocalcemia and hyperexcitability • Hypocalcemia (↓Ca) • Can also cause hyperexcitability of nervous system (puerperal tetany). Why might low extracellular Ca2+ cause a motor neuron to become more excitable? Consolidation 5: a toxic bird species, the pitohui (Pithohui spp.) Pitohui possess a neurotoxin In 1989, ornithologist Jack Dumbacher caught a pitohui in a net in New Guinea. After handling the bird, he inadvertently touched his lips… and his tongue and lips went numb! Feeding a few mgs of hooded pitohui skin to a mouse will kill it within minutes! Batrachotoxin is found on the bird’s feathers. Obtained from an insect diet, and secreted via preen gland Batrachotoxins Phyllobates terribilis • “Batrachos” signifies “frog” in greek • Binds to, and irreversibly opens voltage- gated sodium ion channels • How does this disable transmission of neural signals?","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
