Background In DLS there are usually several third-year projects which involve cloning. One third-year project student (Tina Herfolt) was attempting to clone a gene using a PCR-based cloning kit from Invitrogen (TOPO-TA). In short, Tina amplified her chosen gene using PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) and then put the gene into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Figure 1). This vector has the genetic material for both kanamycin and ampicillin resistance, β- galactosidase (lacZα) and a MCS (multiple cloning site). Organisms that produce the β-galactosidase enzyme can breakdown X-gal (colourless) into galactose and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-hydroxyindole. 5-bromo-4-chloro-3- hydroxyindole spontaneously forms a dimer which turns bright blue. If Tina’s experiment was successful, her gene should be inserted in the middle of the lacZα gene, disrupting it and making it non-functional. Successful clones should be white, because they lack the enzyme to breakdown X-gal. Unsuccessful clones should be blue, because the gene encoding the β-galactosidase enzyme is not disrupted and therefore breaks down X-gal into a blue compound. When she then transformed her new plasmid into E. coli competent cells, she plated her cells onto selective plates that contained LB agar (nutrients for cells), kanamycin (antibiotic) and X-gal (lactose analog broken down by β-galactosidase). The next day when she looked at her plates she found blue colonies and white colonies. Unfortunately, Tina ran out of time on her project and left her strains in the fridge for the following year’s projects. This year several project students need to use Tina’s clone, but horror! Tina had only labelled her strains with her name! All we know is that one of Tina’s strains is labelled A and the other is labelled B, we don’t know whether either strain contains cloned DNA or not. Tina’s supervisor has understandably reacted badly to this development and was last seen heading towards the Arts Centre Bar with mascara running down her cheeks. It is up to us to save Tina’s supervisor from alcoholism by identifying which strain of E. coli contains her cloned DNA and what that cloned DNA is. And we have just one week to do so.... Figure 1. Vector map of pCR2.1-TOPO. The region of ‘PCR Product’ is where her gene inserted, if the cloning reaction was successful. The DNA sequence above the plasmid image represents the Multiple Cloning Site of the plasmid, which is within the lacZα gene. The empty plasmid (without the inserted gene) is 3.9 kb long. Practical Schedule Overview Your task is to characterise the plasmid in each strain (A and B) using several molecular methods. Monday First you will prepare selective media plates and liquid cultures of each of Tina’s unknown samples. Tuesday You will be extracting plasmid DNA from each of the liquid cultures. There are three ways to determine which strain is which: restriction digest, PCR amplification and transformation. A restriction digest is the process of cutting DNA into smaller pieces using restriction enzymes. These enzymes search for a specific sequence of DNA and cut only at that site. The restriction enzyme you will use is EcoRI (see the sites in Figure 1). This enzyme looks for the sequence: It cuts at the arrows leaving sticky-ends, or single-stranded overhangs which can then be glued to other pieces of DNA that were cut the same way. For both samples you should have two pieces of DNA after the restriction digest. However, one of the pieces in the Blue sample will be so small that you won’t see it on a gel. PCR amplification is the process of making many copies of a specific piece of DNA. By providing small pieces of DNA that are specific to the sequence you are interested in, you can make several million copies of the sequence. The correct ‘White’ strain should have a much larger PCR product than the ‘Blue’ sample. Thursday Unfortunately, you cannot look at the samples from a restriction digest and PCR and be able to tell whether they worked or not. To visualize the reaction we perform DNA electrophoresis, where the DNA pieces are loaded onto an agarose gel. The gel acts live a sieve where small pieces of DNA travel farther than large pieces. The final method is a transformation. This is a way of putting plasmid DNA into competent cells. In this way you will be performing the same final step as Tina. You should get white colonies if the plasmid contains cloned DNA, and blue colonies if the plasmid does not contain cloned DNA. Friday On the final day you will look at the gel electrophoresis and transformation results. By the end of the week using all three methods you should be able to make a convincing conclusion about which sample is which and whether either have cloned DNA in them. PS. The original TOPO-TA cloning manual can be found on Blackboard. Day One (Monday): You are provided with two strains. One is labelled A and the other is labelled B. Your bench has a number assigned to it. ALWAYS label ALL tubes, on the LID, with your bench number. Prepare selective plates. 1. Label the underside of 5 petri dishes with your names and bench number. Label around the edge, not on the center of the plate. 2. Using aseptic technique (consult with demonstrator) pour molten LB agar (containing kanamycin and X- gal) into each petri dish just until the bottom of each dish is covered. 3. Cover with the lid and wait for the agar to set completely solid (about 30 minutes to 1 hour), then place lid down. 4. Your plates will be incubated in a 37 oC incubator overnight. Set up a fresh culture of strains A and B. 1. Label two universal tubes containing LB with your name, the date, and whether they contain strain A or B. 2. Label the lids with your bench number. 3. Grab a demonstrator (metaphorically). Using aseptic technique and advice from your demonstrator (this also involves a lit Bunsen burner, and an inoculating loop), transfer one colony of A into the tube labelled ‘A’ and repeat with a colony of B into the tube labelled ‘B’. 4. Your liquid cultures will be incubated overnight, with shaking, at 37 oC. . Day Two (Tuesday): Extraction of plasmid DNA from cultures A and B 1. Inspect your overnight cultures. 2. If both cultures are turbid (cloudy) due to bacterial growth, proceed to step 3. If not, consult a demonstrator. 3. Transfer 2 x 1.5 ml of each culture into labelled Eppendorf tubes (two for A, two for B). 4. Centrifuge the Eppendorf’s for 2 minutes at 11,000 x g. Make sure the tubes are balanced in the centrifuge and that the lid is firmly on before starting. (NB Traditionally there is no verb ‘to centrifuge’, so the above instruction is guilty of using lab jargon. The proper phrase should have been ‘Subject your cultures to centrifugation for 2 minutes.’) 5. Remove and dispose of the supernatant using a pipette, without disturbing the pelleted bacteria. 6. Re-suspend (dissolve) each pellet in 125 μL of buffer P1. Pool your A samples together, and your B samples together. You should now have 250 μL of A and 250 μL of B. 7. Add 250 μL of buffer P2 (DANGER ALKALI – gloves and glasses) and mix gently by inverting the tube 6-8 times (after you’ve shut the lid). 8. Add 300 μL of buffer P3 (DANGER ACID – gloves and glasses) and mix gently by inverting 6-8 times. It should go gloopy. 9. Spin at full speed for 5 minutes at 11,000 x g. (NB ‘To spin’ is even worse than ‘to centrifuge’. Subject to maximum speed centrifugation for 10 minutes.) a. While the centrifuge is doing its business put the bottle of buffer EBP into the 50 oC water bath. b. You can also perform the procedure below titled ‘Check plates from Day One’, while the centrifuge is spinning. 10. Collect up to 750 µL of supernatant (DO NOT DISCARD) without touching the pellet, and transfer to a spin column within a collection tube (ask a demonstrator). Label. 11. Spin for 1 minute and discard the flow-through (the liquid in the collection tube). 12. Add 0.5 mL of buffer PW1 (DANGER – DENATURANT) to the column and centrifuge for 1 minute. Discard the flow-through again. 13. Add 0.6 mL of buffer PW2 (DANGER – FLAMMABLE) to the column and subject to centrifugation for 1 minute. 14. Replace the collection tube with a fresh one and centrifuge again for 2 minutes. Yes, the collection tube does not fit perfectly, it will be fine. 15. Replace the collection tube again, and then add 50 μL of buffer EBP to the spin column (directly onto the silica filter). 16. Wait for 1 minute and then spin (the tubes, not yourself) for 1 minute (in a centrifuge). 17. Transfer the eluent in the collection tube to a fresh lidded Eppendorf tube and label properly (one tube contains pA, the other contains pB). 18. These tubes contain your purified plasmids – label them clearly with pA or pB and put your bench number on the top. 19. Leave them in your ice bucket. Eppendorf tube Spin column in a collection tube Restrict your Plasmids 1. For each of your plasmids (pA and pB) set up the following reactions in labelled Eppendorf’s: a. 5 μL of plasmid DNA, 5 μL of EcoRI solution b. The EcoRI solution contains RE buffer (10x): water: EcoRI at a ratio of 1:3:1. 2. Incubate both reactions at 37 oC for 1 hour and then put them on ice. 3. Label the lids with your bench number and pAEcoRI or pBEcoRI and leave them in the ice bucket. Set up a PCR Reaction for each Plasmid 1. For each plasmid (pA and pB) make a 100-fold dilution by transferring 2 μL of plasmid into a clean Eppendorf, and then adding 198 μL of water. Label and leave in your ice bucket. 2. For each of your plasmids set up the following reactions in labelled mini-tubes: a. 2 μL of diluted plasmid DNA, 48 μL of PCR mix (which already contains 2 μL of primer mix, 21 μL of water, and 25 μL of PCR Master Mix (2x) per 48 μL). 3. Label your tubes with A or B and bench number on the lids and place in the thermocycler. A demonstrator will perform the PCR reaction overnight. Check plates from Day One 1. Throw away any contaminated plates. 2. If you have 2 or more plates left, ignore step 3. 3. If you have 0 or 1 plates left from step 2, repeat ‘Prepare selective plates’ as for Day One IMPORTANT - BEFORE YOU LEAVE: • Give a demonstrator your diluted and un-diluted plasmid samples (4 total) and your restriction digests (2 total). These will be stored in a freezer until Thursday. • A technician will use a nano-drop spectrophotometer to analyse the DNA concentration of some of the plasmid samples. This may influence the volumes used in the transformation protocol on Thursday. Day Three (Thursday): DNA electrophoresis The demonstrators will demonstrate how to pour a 1 % agarose gel. While the gel is solidifying prepare samples for loading onto the gel. 1. Each sample consists of 10 μL of DNA, and 2 μL of dark blue loading buffer (6x). 2. You need to prepare 4 samples: pAEcoRI pBEcoRI pAPCR pBPCR 3. If you get sample or loading buffer on the side of the tube, spin them in a centrifuge to collect it at the bottom of the tube. 4. With a demonstrator’s assistance load your samples onto the gel in the following order: Ladder pAEcoRI pBEcoRI pAPCR pBPCR 5. Connect the electrophoresis tank to a power pack and apply 100 V for 1 hour. 6. Your demonstrators will then reduce the voltage to run the gel overnight. Transformation of E. coli Pedantic semantic note: you can transform E. coli by introducing a plasmid into it, you can’t transform a plasmid into E. coli. 1. In an ice bucket prepare two CONICAL (not straight-walled) 1.5 ml Eppendorf’s – each containing 2 μL of your undiluted plasmids (pA and pB). *Subject to nano-drop determined plasmid concentrations. 2. To both tubes add 10 μL of competent E. coli from the icebath and keep on ice for 10 minutes. 3. Transfer the tubes to a 42 oC waterbath for exactly 2 minutes, and then put them back onto ice. a. This makes the cell membrane permeable and allows the plasmid to enter the cell. Placing them on ice then makes the membrane less permeable again. 4. Using aseptic techniques (demonstrator help advisable), add 1 mL of liquid LB media to each tube. 5. Label tubes on their lids with your bench number and ‘A’ or ‘B’ and give to a demonstrator, who will incubate them at 37 oC for 1 hour with vigorous shaking. a. This step allows the bacteria to recover and develop the antibiotic resistance before being placed on plates with the antibiotic (kanamycin). 6. Label two of your plates ‘pA’, and ‘pB’. 7. After the hour, subject your tubes to centrifugation for 60 seconds and then remove and discard the supernatants. 8. Re-suspend each pellet (yes, it’s supposed to be small/barely visible) in 25 ul of LB (using aseptic technique) and spot onto the centre of the appropriately-labelled plate. 9. Spread the drop of liquid over the surface of each plate using a sterile spreader (different spreader for each plate), until all the liquid has soaked in. 10. Give your plates to a demonstrator. 11. Your plates (lid downwards) will be incubated overnight at 37 oC. Day Four (Friday): Gel Electrophoresis: 1. The gel will be viewed under UV in a gel documentation system. 2. Compare the EcoRI samples. How many bands do you see? What is the size of each band? 3. Compare the PCR samples. What is the size of each fragment in pA? pB? Transformation Results 1. Retrieve your plates from the incubator 2. What colour are the colonies on each plate? 3. How many colonies are on each plate? 4. Add your results to the class data on the whiteboard. 5. Interpret your results. And finally… Which of Tina’s samples has her cloned gene in it? How can you tell? If there is any cloned DNA, how big is it? Can you use the sequence data on Blackboard to identify the cloned DNA?","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
