Hormones diffuse into circulatory fluids, which carry them to their targets The endocrine system provides a second major control system complementing the nervous system Endocrine signalling. Not to be confused with… • Paracrine signalling – secreted molecules diffuse locally and affect neighbouring cells • Autocrine signalling – secreted molecules diffuse locally and affect the cell that secreted them • Synaptic signalling – You know this one! Hormones Chemically classified as peptides, steroids, or amines Between classes there are critical differences in solubility… Water-soluble Lipid-soluble Steroid: Cortisol Polypeptide: Insulin Amine: Epinephrine Amine: Thyroxine 0.8 nm Synthesis Peptides synthesised within organelles, packaged into vesicles, stored Steroids synthesised from cholesterol using enzymes, immediately diffuse across cell membrane (not stored) Amines synthesised from amino acid tyrosine; stored until secreted Water-soluble Lipid-soluble Steroid: Cortisol Polypeptide: Insulin Amine: Epinephrine Amine: Thyroxine 0.8 nm Transport Hydrophilic peptides (mostly) dissolve in blood plasma Lipophilic steroids and amines are bound to plasma proteins (only the unbound hormone is biologically active) Catecholamines do both, roughly 50:50 Water-soluble Lipid-soluble Steroid: Cortisol Polypeptide: Insulin Amine: Epinephrine Amine: Thyroxine 0.8 nm Action Water-soluble Lipid-soluble Steroid: Cortisol Polypeptide: Insulin Amine: Epinephrine Amine: Thyroxine 0.8 nm Hydrophilic peptides and catecholamines… • Cannot cross cell membrane • Cell surface receptors activate ion channels or second messenger systems, activating enzymes or protein synthesis Lipophilic steroids and thyroid hormones… • Can cross cell membrane • Internal receptors, typically transcription factors that regulate gene expression Receptors are key: hormones circulate throughout body, only target cells with appropriate receptors respond Permissiveness, Synergism, Antagonism • Permissive effects • One hormone permits another’s effect • Thyroid hormone increases sensitivity to adrenaline • Synergistic effects • Effects greater than sum of parts • Testosterone and FSH are both required for sperm production • Antagonistic effects • One hormone reduces the effectiveness of another • Progesterone decreases uterine responsiveness to estrogen Major endocrine glands: Adrenal glands Hypothalamus Pineal gland Pituitary gland Thyroid gland Parathyroid glands Pancreas Kidney Ovaries Testes Organs containing endocrine cells: Thymus Heart Liver Stomach Kidney Small intestine Organs of the mammalian endocrine system Endocrine system (1) • Classification of hormones and endocrine function • Key principles: negative feedback loops & antagonistic action • More on feedback loops Pancreatic islets of Langerhans 99% of cells produce digestive enzymes (exocrine function [bicarbonate ions & digestive enzymes]; pancreatic duct to small intestine) 1-2 million clusters of endocrine cells called islets of Langerhans Alpha cells secrete glucagon Beta cells secrete insulin Homeostasis: Blood glucose level (about 90 mg/100 mL) Glucagon STIMULUS: Blood glucose level falls. Alpha cells of pancreas release glucagon. Hepatocytes: •  glycogenolysis (glycogen  glucose) •  gluconeogenesis (glucose production) Blood glucose level rises. STIMULUS: Blood glucose level rises. Beta cells of pancreas release insulin into the blood. Hepatocytes: • glycogenesis (glucose  glycogen) •  glycogenolysis •  gluconeogenesis Blood glucose level declines.

Stimulated by oxytocin. Uterine contraction during labour is also stimulated by oxytocin. Oxytocin receptors on uterine smooth muscle increase pre-labour to increase sensitivity. Labour is sometimes induced with Pitocin (synthetic OT). Suckling Mechanoreceptors in nipple Hypothalamus Oxytocin secretion from posterior pituitary Contraction of myoepithelial cells & milk letdown Stretching of cervix Mechanoreceptors in muscle Hypothalamus Oxytocin secretion from posterior pituitary Contraction of uterine muscle Why does positive feedback make sense in these contexts?
