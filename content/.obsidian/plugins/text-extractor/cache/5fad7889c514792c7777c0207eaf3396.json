Respiration / catabolism • 3. Using sugars for energy • 4. Aerobic metabolism • 5. Anaerobic metabolism (fermentation) • 6. Alternative Energy • 7. Derailment of metabolism Metabolism: a definition “The entire set of chemical reactions that convert molecules into other molecules and transfer energy in living organisms”. Metabolic classification of organisms • Energy comes from light, or from chemicals • Carbon comes from organic or inorganic (CO2) sources. • Organisms can be classified according to their energy and carbon sources. Think about your own subject area…….. • Diversity of organisms • How would you classify these organisms?

Different forms of energy and energy transformations • Chemical energy is a form of potential energy. • Held in chemical bonds between atoms. H2O, NO3, CO2 Different forms of energy and energy transformations • Chemical energy is a form of potential energy. • Held in chemical bonds between atoms. H2O, NO3, CO2 High Chemical Energy <=======> Low Chemical Energy Different forms of energy and energy transformations • Reactions rely on input or output of energy H2O, NO3, CO2 High Chemical Energy =============> Low Chemical Energy Loss of energy Different forms of energy and energy transformations • Reactions rely on input or output of energy • Chemical Reactions are reversible H2O, NO3, CO2 High Chemical Energy <============= Low Chemical Energy Input of energy Laws of thermodynamics First law: energy in the universe is constant and neither created nor destroyed CO2 Heat NO3 H2O Heat Heat Nitroglycerine O2 Heat Chemical reactions of metabolism • Atoms keep their identity but bonds linking atoms change. • e.g. covalent bonds involve the sharing of electron pairs between molecules. • Most chemical reactions in cells are reversible. • Direction of reaction governed by relative energy of reactants and products. Laws of thermodynamics govern whether chemical reactions require or provide free energy (- or + DG) ATP and energy production within cells • Cells provide energy to power reactions in the form of chemical energy (ATP). Electrical Elastic Nuclear Potential Thermal Electromagnetic SoundKinetic Gravitational The importance of ATP • Adenosine TRIphosphate = ATP • Adenosine DIphosphate = ADP • Adenosine MONOphosphate = AMP ATP hydrolysis is an exergonic reaction Cells harness energy for metabolism • Catabolic reactions result in a release of energy (and negative ΔG), often as ATP. • Anabolic reactions require input of energy, often in the form of ATP (and positive ΔG). • Hydrolysis of ATP releases energy which the cell can use for metabolism. Energetic coupling in chemical reactions Coupling an unfavourable reaction with ATP hydrolysis can make it favourable Reactions can be coupled by enzymes Characteristics of enzymes Enzymes are proteins which catalyse a specific reaction, converting substrates into products. Specificity is determined by the shape of the enzyme – complementary to that of the substrate. Enzymes catalyse chemical reactions • Enzymes reduce the activation energy, accelerating the chemical reaction. • They cannot make reactions more or less favourable (except by coupling two reactions together). They can be regulated by small inhibitors/activators, or by reversible modification of the enzyme. • Allosteric modulation refers to reversible binding of small molecules to enzyme at sites other than active site- causes conformational change in enzyme. • Covalent modulation refers to reversible addition of free phosphate (Pi) causing shape change in enzyme. Key messages • Laws of thermodynamics govern energy conservation, transfer and use. • Chemical reactions occur when molecules interact, and these reactions perform much of the work of cells. • ATP is the molecule used for energy by many cells to power chemical reactions.
