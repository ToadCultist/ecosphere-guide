Circulatory System • All animals require oxygen for aerobic respiration. • Challenges faced: ✓ To deliver O2 to the cells within its body. • But….the diffusion of O2 is very slow. ✓ Body plan where the cells are in direct contact with the environment. ✓ To evolve a circulatory system to deliver the O2. Diffusion • There are a few animals that do not have specific respiratory organs or a circulatory system…but there are limitations: ✓ Low metabolic rate ✓ Small (large SA:V) ✓ Boundary layer ✓ Cellular organisation Circulatory Systems • Most animals cannot rely on diffusion alone… • The require a circulatory system. • The functions of a circulatory system are…. ✓ To deliver O2 to cells/organs. ✓ To remove CO2. ✓ To transport other solutes/nutrients. ✓ To transport heat ✓ To enable movement. ✓ Providing an immune response etc. Circulatory Systems • What are the main requirements of a circulatory system?… ✓ Circulatory fluid. ✓ Interconnecting tubes. ✓ Pump – contractile mechanism. • Two main types of circulatory system: ✓ Open circulatory system. ✓ Closed circulatory system. Open Circulatory Systems Invertebrates Open Circulatory Systems • Flow into spaces between the tissues called sinuses and lacunae. • Movement assists with the flow. • Open circulatory system consists of a heart with vessels which are open. • The circulating fluids bathe the tissues directly. Open Circulatory Systems • During relaxation the ligaments expands the heart back to its original volume. • Circulatory fluid is called haemolymph. • When the heart contracts haemolymph is driven into the arteries and out into the sinuses and lacunae. • Ostia close. • Ostia open bringing in haemolymph from the pericardial sinus. Advantages of Open Circulatory Systems ✓ Lower hydrostatic pressure – reduced energy costs. • What are the advantages of a open circulatory system? • Spiders use the hydrostatic pressure to extend their legs. Closed Circulatory Systems Invertebrates Closed Circulatory Systems • Heart/s contracts and blood is driven into large vessels, then smaller vessels, which pass through tissues/organs. • Annelids, cephalopods and vertebrates. • Circulatory fluid is contained within a network of vessels. Advantages of Closed Circulatory Systems ✓ Increased hydrostatic pressure! ✓ Regulate the distribution of the blood. • What are the advantages of a closed circulatory system? Octopus and Squid • Active cephalopods with 3 “hearts”: systemic heart and two smaller auxiliary branchial hearts. • This arrangement allows for re- pressurisation of blood prior to entering the gills and allows for fast blood flow rates. Closed Circulatory Systems Vertebrates Vertebrate Closed Circulatory Systems ✓ Heart 2-4 chambered. ✓ Arteries – take blood from the heart to organs. ✓ Arterioles within organs pass blood into the capillaries. ✓ Capillaries are where gaseous exchanges occurs. ✓ Capillaries converge into venules. ✓ Venules carry blood into the veins. ✓ Veins carry the blood to the heart. • Within vertebrates the cardiovascular system is organised into: Vertebrate Closed Circulatory Systems ✓ Atria – receive the blood. ✓ Ventricles – muscular pumping force. • The complexity of the cardiovascular system varies: dependent on the complexity of the animal, metabolic rate and activity levels. • Heart have between 2 to 4 chambers. Single Circulatory Systems ✓ Sinus venosus – collects the blood prior to it entering the atrium. ✓ Conus arteriosus – evens out blood pressure. • Teleosts, rays and sharks have a two chambered heart. • Blood passes through the heart once: single circulatory system. Double Circulatory Systems • Amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals have double circulatory systems. • Blood passes through the heart twice: double circulatory system. • The pumps serve different tissues. ✓ Pulmonary circuit – blood from the right. ✓ Systemic circuit – blood from the left. Double Circulatory Systems • The ability to re-pressurise the blood twice allows for… ✓ The efficient and rapid delivery of blood flow to the organs including the brain and muscles. • The blood pressure in the systemic circuit is often greater than in the pulmonary circuit. • Helps protect the lungs from damage and facilitates O2 uptake/CO2 loss. Amphibians ✓ 2 Atria. ✓ 1 Ventricle. • Amphibians have a 3 chambered heart. • When submerged shut down blood flow to the lungs. • Ridge between the right and left ventricle reduces mixing. ✓ Diverts oxygen poor blood from the right atrium into the pulmocutaneous circuit. ✓ Diverts oxygen rich blood into the systemic circuit. • Reptiles have a 3 chambered heart with the exception of the crocodilians. • Ventricle is divided into 2 chambers. • The pulmonary and systemic circuits meet where aorta leave the heart: foramen of Panizza. Reptiles: Crocodilians • Allows for cardiac shunting. • Bird and mammals have a 4 chambered heart. • No mixing of the oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. • Required in organisms with a high metabolic rate: endotherms Mammals and Birds • The right side only receives and pumps deoxygenated blood, and the left only oxygenated. • The cardiac cycle is composed of two distinct physiological functions: 4 Chambered Heart ✓ Contraction, the heart pumps the blood: systole. ✓ Relaxation, the chambers fills with blood: diastole. • The cardiac output is the volume of blood pumped by the left ventricle in a minute. Cardiac Output = Heart Rate x Stroke Volume (mL/minute) (beats/minute) (mL/beat) • The human heart has 4 values which are composed of connective tissue: 4 Chambered Heart ✓ Atrioventricular (AV) valves: located between the atrium and ventricles. ✓ Semilunar valves: found in the pulmonary trunk and aorta. • They are very important in maintaining the unidirectional flow of blood through the heart. • The cells of the heart are myogenic: autorhythmic. • The cells of the heart are controlled by a pacemaker called sinoatrial (S-A) node. • Atrioventricular (A-V) node, A-V bundle branches and Purkinje fibres allows for the rapid spread of depolarisation than would otherwise be possible through the ventricles. Heart “Beat”Heart “Beat” • The 0.1 second delay is very important to allow for the emptying of the atria before the contraction of the ventricles. Electrocardiogram (ECG) The Role of “Blood” and Blood Vessels • Patterns of blood pressure and flow reflect the structure and arrangement of the vessels. Blood Vessels ✓ Capillaries: narrow diameter and thin walls to facilitate the exchange of substances. ✓ Arteries: thick elastic walls to maintain blood pressure. ✓ Veins: 0.3 x thickness of arteries, contain valves to assist in blood flow back to the heart. • Variable bloody velocity in the circulatory system. • Blood velocity slows as it passes into the capillaries. • Capillary beds speed of blood is x 500 slower than in the aorta. • Arteries, arterioles and capillaries reduction in the blood pressure. Blood Flow Velocity • There are several different types of respiratory pigment: haemoglobin, haemocyanin, haemerythrin and chlorocruorins. • They have several functions: ✓ Increase the oxygen carrying capacity of blood. ✓ Buffer blood. ✓ Transport CO2. Blood Pigments • Haemoglobin contained within erythrocytes. • 5-6 millions erythrocytes per µl! …~25 trillion in 5 litres! • Bi-concave discs 7-8 µm in diameter and anucleate. • ~250 million Hb molecules per corpuscle. • They last ~120 days. • Made in the red bone marrow. • Obtain energy via anaerobic metabolism: Embden Meyerhof pathway. Erythrocytes • The binding of oxygen and haemoglobin is reversible. Oxygen Dissociation Curves Hb + O2 HbO2 ✓ At high O2 partial pressure Hb binds to O2. ✓ At low partial pressure O2 is offloaded. • Low O2 partial pressure in the capillaries. • In the lungs 100 mm Hg (98% saturation); at rest the tissues 40 mm Hg (68% saturation) = offloaded 30% of O2. Oxygen Dissociation Curves ✓ Temperature. ✓ pCO2 ✓ pH ✓ 2,3-DPG levels • During exercise drop to 20 mm Hg = 75% offloaded. • Affinity influenced by: • When CO2 diffuses into the blood there are 3 processes that can occur: Relationship of CO2 and Hb ✓ Stay as dissolved CO2 in plasma (≈ 5-10%). ✓ Taken into the RBC resulting in the offloading of O2 (≈ 80%). ✓ Bind to Hb to form HbCO2 carbamino haemoglobin (≈ 5- 10%). CO2 + H2O → HCO3 - + H+ CO2 + Hb → HbCO2 H+ + HbO2 → HHb + O2 • The chloride shift occurs at the capillary beds. Chloride Shift • HCO3- in the RBC is exchanged for Cl- in the plasma. • Function is to…. ✓ Increases the ability of the blood to carry CO2. ✓ It buffers the change in pH. ✓ It acts to destabilise the binding of oxygen to haemoglobin: allosteric modulator. • The Haldane effect occurs at the lungs. • The Bohr effect is the phenomenon whereby the affinity of haemoglobin to bind to O2 is influenced by CO2 (pH). Bohr Effect • It enhances oxygen delivery to metabolically active the tissues. • The greater the CO2 the greater the offload of O2. • An increase in the partial pressure of CO2 causes a decrease in the pH. Ventilation of Respiratory Structures • Aquatic organisms need to extract O2 from water. • Problems… ✓ Content of oxygen in water is lower. ✓ Water is much denser than air (x 800). ✓ Water viscosity is greater (x 35). ✓ Slow rates of diffusion in water. • Aquatic organisms must move 1 litre of water to extract 1 ml O2 compared to 25 ml of air! Problems with Extracting O2 from Water • Solubility of the gas in water is dependent on: ✓ The gas. ✓ The pressure of the gas. ✓ Temperature of the water. ✓ The presence of solutes. Problems with Extracting O2 from Water The Principles • Gas exchange occurs by diffusion. • Net movement from a high [O2] to low [O2]. [O2] [O2] [CO2]  [CO2] • Very thin membrane separating internal tissues from the environment. • Via diffusion or convection: ventilation. Gas Exchange via Diffusion • There are a few animals that do not have specific respiratory organs or a circulatory system…but there are limitations: ✓ Low metabolic rate ✓ Small (large SA:V) ✓ Boundary layer ✓ Cellular organisation Boundary Layer • In water animals are subject to the boundary layer effect. • This creates a layer of water around the animal which is stationary. • This limits [O2] and nutrient delivery to the surface.By F l a n k e r - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, ttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=3602085 • Organisms that use diffusion for gaseous exchange are typically...By F l a n k e r - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, ttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=3602085 Boundary Layer…Solutions! ✓ Small (large SA:V). ✓ Low metabolic rate. ✓ Motile. ✓ Cell located adjacent to the environment. • What are the advantages? ✓ Inexpensive! • For the vast majority of organisms diffusion is not sufficient to meet O2 demands. • Convective gas transport is required to meet the demands of cells >1 mm away from the source. • Evolved specific respiratory structures which have: Oxygen Requirements ✓ Large surface area. ✓ Very thin. ✓ Often have an associated blood/haemolymph supply. • The partial pressure of oxygen is very important in gas transport and offloading as it determines the rate of supply. • O2 is delivered at a rate that is dependent on the difference in the partial pressure between the blood and the mitochondria. The Oxygen Cascade • Partial pressure must be kept high to ensure the mitochondrial O2 demands are met. • Countercurrent exchange allows for a greater level of oxygen transfer to the blood than cocurrent. The Importance of Blood Flow • Crosscurrent exchange allows for a greater level of oxygen transfer to the blood than tidal. The Importance of Blood Flow • Within organisms typically find gills or lungs. Respiratory Structures ✓ Branchial – related to gills. ✓ Pulmonary – related to lungs • Gills can be internal or external. External Gills ➢ ventilation not required; vulnerable to damage and require structural support. Internal Gills ➢ protected and have enhanced efficiency; ventilation required. Active vs. Passive • Ventilation can be passive or active. Passive ventilation ➢ energy not expended; external gills (vulnerable to damage and require structural support). Active ventilation ➢ Reliable, controllable and more effective; energy required, muscles/cilia required. Aquatic Gills • Variety of different gills: ✓ Tuft – raise area of integument. ✓ Filament – typically associated with blood/haemolymph supply. ✓ Book – Limulus. ✓ Lamellar – crustaceans and fish. Lamellar Gills: Crustacea • Characterised by flattened lamellar plates. • Internal: protected by the carapace within the branchial chamber. • Ventilation occurs via beating of the scaphognathite. • Gills have extra support in intertidal and terrestrial species. • Gill filaments supported by the gill arch. • V- shaped arrangement. Lamellar Gills: Fish • Secondary lamellae arise from the filament. • Highly vascularised: countercurrent blood flow. • Buccal-opercular pumping. • Two chambers: buccal cavity and opercular cavity that are separated by the gills. • Water in through the mouth. Lamellar Gills: Fish • Water out through the operculum • Unidirectional flow. • RAM ventilation. • Three main respiratory organs found in terrestrial organisms: ✓ Lamellar gills: terrestrial crustaceans. ✓ Trachea: found in insects ✓ Lungs: diffusion and ventilation. Terrestrial Respiratory Organs • Air delivered directly to the tissues, the circulatory system has no role. Tracheal System in Insects • Trachea connected to the atmosphere via pores: spiracles. • Trachea branch into smaller tracheoles. • Gas transport via diffusion. • Air sacs present: enlargements of the tracheal system. ✓ Conspicuous ventilation: http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&v=v_GP_gIxTCo. ✓ Autoventilation. ✓ Microscopic ventilation. Tracheal System in Insects • Spiracles important in the control of breathing. • Amphibians have gills (as tadpoles), lungs (as adults and also undergo cutaneous respiration (tadpoles and adults). • Lungs are simple convoluted sacs ventilated by buccopharyngeal pumping. Ventilation in Amphibians • Varying complexity: ✓ Unicameral: simple single chambered lung, not always perfused with blood: snakes and lizards. ✓ Multicameral: complex multiple chambers with bronchi: monitor lizards and crocodiles. • Massive variability within the taxon. • Operates via suction involving contractions of the intercostal, abdominal and thoracic muscles. Ventilation in Reptiles • Two main mechanisms: ✓ Snakes: use their ribs to ventilate lungs: levator costa muscles contract reducing the volume of the lungs (exhale). Elastic recoil returns them to their original size (inhale). ✓ Crocodiles: intercostal muscles, transversus abdominis muscle, rectus abdominis muscles all contract reducing the volume of abdomen and thoracic cavity (exhale). Contraction of the diaphrgmaticus, ischiopubis and ischiotruncus muscles increase the volume of the thoracic cavity (inhale) Ventilation in Reptiles ✓ 23% O2 uptake across integument. ✓ 100% CO2 offload across integument. • Hydrophis platurus • Complex lungs with alveoli. • Operates via suction involving the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles: external and internal. • Gaseous exchange occurs within the alveoli, very thin membranes 0.2 µm. • Tidal breathing: lungs never empty completely 500 cm3 (total) - 150 cm3 (dead space) = 350 cm3 (exchanged) Ventilation in Mammals • Phospholipids “pulmonary surfactant” reduce surface tension in the alveoli and helps to keep all the alveoli the same size. • Inhalation: contraction of the diaphragm, external intercostal and anterior internal intercostal muscles. Results in a drop in air pressure and an expansion of lung volume. • Exhalation: relaxation of all muscles. Results an increase in air pressure and a reduction of lung volume. Ventilation in Mammals • Anser indicus, bar-headed goose. • Migrate over the Himalayas in one day! • Ascend 4,000-6,000 m in 7-8 hours! • Remain within 340 m of the ground. • Comatose mammals! Anser indicus • Paleopulmonal system: a system of air sacs and lungs: parabronchi. • Lungs ramify into bones making them lighter. • Gaseous exchange occurs in the parabronchi. Ventilation in Birds • Anterior/cranial sacs: cervical sac, interclavicular sac and anterior thoracic. • Posterior/caudal sacs: posterior thoracic and abdominal. Ventilation in Birds • During exhalation the air flow through the mesobronchus is minimal. • Takes TWO cycles for the air to pass through. Inhalation Exhalation Post. sacs Ant. sacs PARABRONCHI MESOBRONCHUS Ventilation in Birds • Contraction of the internal intercostal and thoracic muscles increases the volume in the air sacs. • External intercostal and abdominal muscles decreases the volume in the air sacs. • Parabronchi are the sites of gaseous exchange, they do not change volume. • Blood flow is crosscurrent. • Ventilation is via bellows action. • Adaptations: ✓ Heightened hypoxia tolerance with greater ventilatory rates. ✓ Breath deeper and at a reduced frequency. ✓ Larger lungs (25% bigger compared to low-land birds) ✓ Higher tolerance to low CO2 levels. Birds and Anser indicus ✓ Greater lung volume and very thin exchange surfaces: 0.1-0.2 µm to 0.4-0.8 µm in mammals. ✓ Haemoglobin has a higher affinity to O2 and it has a greater sensitivity to temperature. • Adaptations: ✓ Pulmonary vasculature does not constrict under hypoxia. ✓ Larger hearts and maximal stroke volume. ✓ Capillary density in the heart is greater. ✓ Capillary exchange length (flight muscles) is longer: 6,000 - 14,000 mm-2 to 2,000 - 6,000 mm-2 mammals. ✓ Cerebral blood flow not inhibited by hypocapnia. ✓ Neurones have a higher tolerance to low cellular O2. ✓ The proportion of oxidative flight muscle fibres in higher and the diffusion distances of O2 is reduced.
