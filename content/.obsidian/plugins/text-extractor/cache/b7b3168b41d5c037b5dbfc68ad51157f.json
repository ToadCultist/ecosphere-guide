Example: Italian sparrow • House sparrow – Native to Central Asia • Spread across Europe and Asia in association with introduced crops – Recently introduced worldwide • Spanish sparrow – Native to Mediterranean region • Probably native to Italy • Italian sparrow – Originated from hybrids • between native Spanish sparrows and non-native house sparrows – Now forms a genetically distinct species Question • Are species real? How many bird species in western New Guinea? • Ernst Mayer – Famous ornithologist – Studied museum specimens from western New Guinea – Identified >100 bird species • Arfak people – Live in the forests of western New Guinea – Recognised 136 bird species • All corresponded exactly to those identified by Mayr – Except for one case where the Arfak people lumped two similar species together Question • Why are there so many species? Adaptive radiation • Generalist species – Exploits multiple resources and habitats inefficiently • Specialist species – Exploits a single resource and/or habitat efficiently • Can outcompete generalist species • Empty environments – E.g. new oceanic island or continent following mass extinction – Initially colonised by generalist species • Diversifies into multiple specialist species (niche partitioning) – If environment is large and complex enough for speciation to occur Biogeography and speciation • Speciation – Often occurs in allopatry • Restricted migration between populations – Often due to natural barrier » E.g. sea, river, mountain range • Populations evolve independently – Become ecologically distinct – May become reproductively isolated » Remain separate if they come back into contact – May also occur in sympatry • If reproductive isolation occurs – E.g. due to polyploidy Measuring diversity of species • Species richness – Number of species present • Within a defined area • At a given point in time • Species evenness – Takes into account ecological dominance • Some species may be more numerous than others Species evenness • High evenness – Populations sizes of different species are roughly equal • Typical of tropical rainforest • Low evenness – A few species are very common – Other species are rare • Typical of higher latitudes Simpson’s diversity index • Takes into account richness and evenness • Probability that two random individuals belong to different species – =1-probability that two random individuals belong to the same species • ni=number of individuals of species i • N=total number of individuals • Probability that 1st individual belongs to species i – = ni /N • Probability that 2nd individual belongs to species i – = (ni -1)/(N-1) • Probability that both individuals belong to species i – ni(ni -1)/N(N-1) • Probability that the two individuals belong to the same species – Σni(ni -1)/N(N-1) • Probability that the two individuals belong to different species – 1-Σni(ni -1)/N(N-1)","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
