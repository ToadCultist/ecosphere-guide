Classification of sensory receptors by modality 5 2. Classification by role • Exteroreceptors monitor the external environment • Interoreceptors monitor the internal environment • Proprioceptors send information about movement and position of limbs and body parts 3. Classification by structure 7 Special Senses Taste, smell, vision, hearing, equilibrium Specialised receptors, head General Senses Somatic sensations (skin) Visceral sensations (organs) Simple receptors Sensory Physiology • Basic classification of receptors • Sensory transduction • Comparative physiology of… • …vision • …hearing and balance • …smell and taste • …others Sensitivity & selectivity Receptors are specialised to respond to their adequate stimulus ‘Doctrine of specific nerve energies’ The crayfish muscle receptor organ (MRO) The principle of sensory transduction Stretching dendrites opens ion channels! = a receptor potential (a type of graded potential) =sensory transduction Receptor potentials trigger action potentials in MROResponse to constant stimulation When a stimulus is maintained, many receptors slow down the rate of action potentials:  ADAPTATION Receptors can adapt: i) quickly (Phasic) e.g. touch/pressure ii) slowly (Tonic) e.g. pain, position 1314 Sensory transduction can be more complicated…Sensory Physiology • Basic classification of receptors • Sensory transduction • Comparative physiology of… • …vision • …hearing and balance • …smell and taste • …others Vertebrate camera eyes Optic nerve Fovea (center of visual field) Lens Vitreous humor Optic disk (blind spot) Central artery and vein of the retina Iris Retina ChoroidSclera Ciliary body Suspensory ligament Cornea Pupil Aqueous humor Accommodation: adjustment of lens for near or far vision Relaxed ciliary muscle, taught suspensory ligaments, flat & weakly refractive lens Contracted ciliary muscle, slack suspensory ligaments, more spherical & refractive lens Retina Retina Photoreceptors Light Optic nerve Light To brain Choroid Neurons Cone Rod Ganglion cell Optic nerve axons Amacrine cell Horizontal cell Bipolar cell Pigmented epithelium Two classes of photoreceptor in the retina: rods (more sensitive: low-light vision), and cones (short- (B), medium- (G), long-wavelength (R) sensitive; colour vision) Visual pigments • Retinal (vitamin A derivative), and opsin (protein) • In rods, the visual pigment is called rhodopsin • Rhodopsin is embedded in membranous discs Phototransduction • Absorption of light shifts rhodopsin to the trans isomer • Activates transduction cascade causing Na+ channels to close • This causes the photoreceptor to hyperpolarise • In turn, this stops the release of the neurotransmitter glutamate Recall: 21 Acetylcholine (ACh) has nicotinic and muscarinic receptor subtypes Phototransduction cascade Active rhodopsin activates g-protein transducin Transducin activates cGMP phosphor- diesterase cGMP normally activates Na+ channels Mudpuppy, Necturus Retina Retina Photoreceptors Light Optic nerve Light To brain Choroid Neurons Cone Rod Ganglion cell Optic nerve axons Amacrine cell Horizontal cell Bipolar cell Pigmented epithelium Depending on the kind of glutamate receptors they have, bipolar cells may be excited (depolarised) or inhibited (hyperpolarised) in the light = ON and OFF channels Centre-surround organisation, thanks to horizontal cells Retina Retina Photoreceptors Light Optic nerve Light To brain Choroid Neurons Cone Rod Ganglion cell Optic nerve axons Amacrine cell Horizontal cell Bipolar cell Pigmented epithelium Amacrine cells further tune responses, e.g. selectivity for movement Much fewer retinal ganglion cells than photoreceptors Different types with different properties, e.g. ‘bug detectors’ (type 2 RGC) of toads Axons form the optic nerve Sensory Physiology • Basic classification of receptors • Sensory transduction • Comparative physiology of… • …vision • …hearing and balance • …smell and taste • …others","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
