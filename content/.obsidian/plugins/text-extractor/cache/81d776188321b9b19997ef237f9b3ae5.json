BR17120 Genetics, Evolution and Diversity Dr Dylan Phillips (dwp@aber.ac.uk) MEIOSIS is the reduction division of the nucleus in which the zygotic/somatic number of chromosomes (2n) is reduced to the gametic number (n). Meiosis Fertilisation Meiosis is part of the sexual cycle of reproduction n 2n In MITOSIS each phase of chromatid formation is associated with a nuclear division. In MEIOSIS one chromosome replication is followed by two successive nuclear divisions, meiosis I and meiosis II, giving a reduced chromosome number. Consider the situation for one pair of chromosomes: MITOSIS MEIOSIS I MEIOSIS II anaphase metaphase Zygotic/somatic cell Gametic cell Diagrammatic representation of the main visible events of meiosis in an organism with 2 pairs of chromosomes 1. Leptotene 2. Zygotene 3. Pachytene 4. Diplotene / diakinesis 5. Metaphase I* 6. Prophase II 7. Metaphase II 8. Telophase II *CHIASMA = the cross-shaped arrangement of non-sister chromatids at the point of exchange between homologous chromosomes which occurs during crossing over (aka recombination). Prophase I Meiotic Recombination Crossing over is the reciprocal exchange of genetic material between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes during prophase I of meiosis, which results in new allelic combinations in the daughter cells. Prophase I Anaphase I You can use recombination to produce a genetic map What is Sordaria brevicollis? • Haploid, ascomycete fungus • It is ideal for studying genetic recombination because: • it produces many progeny • the products of every meiosis can be observed directly and are maintained in a linear order. • mutants are available, which allow us to monitor the segregation of genes • We shall use two mutants which have different coloured ascospores • + x Ab or + x S27 Meiosis in the fungus Jones RN and Rickards GK (1991) Practical Genetics, Wiley Perithecia Let’s see how genes segregate • + = wild type allele (black) • m = mutant allele (pale) Let’s see how genes segregate • + = wild type allele (black) • m = mutant allele (pale) How do we map the gene? • No crossover between gene and centromere gives non-recombinant asci • Crossover between gene and centromere gives recombinant asci • The number of recombinant asci is directly related to the number of crossovers formed between the centromere and the gene being mapped • Frequency of crossing over is dependent upon distance Gene can be mapped relative to the centromere simply by scoring the relative frequency of recombinant asci Frequency of crossing over is dependent upon distance Gene x Gene x How are we going to do this? • You will be given a culture dish containing a cross between 2 different strains of fungus: • wild type (black) x S27 (yellow) • wild type (black) x Ab (beige) • These have formed diploid nuclei which have undergone meiosis to form an ascus • Many asci are enclosed in fruiting bodies (perithecia) What do you have to do? • Place a drop of lactic acid/glycerol in the centre of a microscope slide • Select with a needle 4 large perithecia from between the agar plugs in the culture dish, using a dissecting microscope if necessary • Place perithecia in the droplet, apply a coverslip and gently tap each perithecium using the tip of a needle Do not use 100X What do you have to do? • Observe under x10 • If done properly, you should see intact asci spread out like a fan • If your perithecia are not sufficiently squashed, remove your prep from the microscope and gently squash with needle • If your asci are obliterated, you’ll have to start again and be more gentle • Change to x40 and score the actual numbers of recombinant and non-recombinant asci • Score as many as you can (but score them well) • Data uploaded at the end of the practical Recombinant = 8Non-recombinant = 3 Troubleshooting • If your asci are all one colour (mutant or black), you have selected a non-hybrid perithecium • If your asci have no colour, they are immature • In both cases, you’ll need to make new preps • Select perithecia from a ‘useful’ part of the culture dish What do you have to do? • Place a drop of lactic acid/glycerol in the centre of a microscope slide • Select with a needle 4 large perithecia from between the agar plugs in the culture dish, using a dissecting microscope if necessary • Place perithecia in the droplet, apply a coverslip and gently tap each perithecium using the tip of a needle • Score the numbers of recombinant and non-recombinant asci • Data uploaded at the end of the practical Recombinant = 8Non-recombinant = 3 S27 S27 + + + + Ab Ab Ch1 Ch1 S27 S27 Ab Ab Ch1 Ch2 + +Ch2 + +Ch1 Genes on the same chromosome arm = recombination frequency of < 50cM S27 Ab + S27 + + Ab + Recombinant Non-recombinant Yellow BeigeClear BlackLinkedUn-linked Are the Ab & S27 mutations found on the same chromosome?Cross = Ab x S27 • You will be given a culture dish containing a cross between Ab and S27 • Make your preps just as before • Count the number of; • asci with pairs of black ascospores • asci without black ascospores Data collection… • Online form can be accessed via the QR code • Link to form emailed this morning • Teams seminar Friday 20th @ 16:10 • Perform data analysis using class data • It will be recorded","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":""}
