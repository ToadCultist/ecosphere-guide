Word/length limit Up to 1000 words Learning Outcomes to be addressed by the coursework:  Develop an understanding of field surveying skills relevant to conservation Written assignments MUST be in your own words. Do NOT take short cuts by copying even the smallest amount of material from anywhere (including the internet, books or another student’s text). This is plagiarism and will be detected. N.B. Presenting work generated by AI as if it were your own is Unacceptable Academic Practice and you must not do this. AU procedures and penalties for 'Unacceptable Academic Practice' are strict and some may prevent you from qualifying for your degree see: https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/academic-registry/handbook/regulations/uap/ Electronic Submission  (1) Choose an appropriate file name for your work. We recommend that you use the Module Code and Coursework Title – do not include your name as work is marked anonymously. Save your work in Microsoft Office or PDF format. (2) Upload the file to Turnitin by selecting ‘Upload’. (3) Check the file submitted is the correct one and the formatting on the preview page is correct. (4) Complete your submission by selecting ‘Submit’. Guidance on downloading your Turnitin receipt can be found here.  Please note that the ‘Blackboard Assignment’ submission points do not provide receipts.  Unless otherwise noted above, Turnitin allows you to overwrite your submissions. You are advised to submit your work at least once as a draft well before the deadline in case of last- minute problems.  Failure to follow this advice may result in a mark of zero if your submission is not uploaded or is in an unreadable format. Clarification of coursework brief It is your responsibility to ensure that you understand the requirements of the coursework that has been set. AU staff policy is to reply to emails within three working days so you should not expect a response in time to help if you ask for guidance less than three days before the deadline. Page 1 of 4 Cyfadran y Gwyddorau Daear a Bywyd / Faculty of Earth and Life Sciences University policy on late/non-submission Work submitted after the deadline without an approved extension will be given a mark of zero. Extension to coursework deadlines Extensions may be awarded in exceptional circumstances, e.g. on medical grounds, or for genuine, unforeseen personal circumstances such as illness, family problems or death of a relative or close personal friend. You may apply for an extension using the Extension Request Form available to download from the ‘Undergraduate Information’ or ‘Information for Taught PG Students’ module on Blackboard. This should be submitted together with any supporting documentary evidence such as a medical certificate to fsestaff@aber.ac.uk . In order to be awarded an extension, you should submit the Extension Request Form (with appropriate evidence) at least three working days before the deadline. If insufficient evidence is submitted, then the extension may be awarded subject to further evidence being provided by a given date. Failure of computers, printers and backups etc. will not be accepted as reasons for late submission of assessed work. If an extension is granted you should follow the advice on submission provided by FELS Extension team. Please refer to your handbook for further information on Coursework Extensions. If an extension has not been confirmed, then you should always submit an attempt of the work by the deadline. Page 2 of 4 Cyfadran y Gwyddorau Daear a Bywyd / Faculty of Earth and Life Sciences ASSIGNMENT: You will construct a field report where you will document plant, animal data (or both) over a ~five week period from the winter to spring period at Aberystwyth. This will also include details about daylength, general weather conditions and any other relevant factor. The biology that you are expected to focus on is birds (by noting whether a species is singing) or buds (stage of development from bud to leaves). We will provide resources so that you can recognise birdsongs and buds in the field. However, you can note other observations including the development of any other plants and animals that you know. This portfolio will be written concisely and in the past tense. It will include data on key events and biological findings in the field. We recommend that you spend at least one hour collecting data weekly but those that want to engage more can do so. The suggested portfolio word count is up to 1000 words allowing scope for those that want to include more to do so. References are not included in the word count. To complete the portfolio, you must construct a short synthesis section at the end. Here you have the opportunity to collate any findings, present any data in graphical form and discuss your results in relation to the literature. You may decide to compare the development of tree species (% bud burst) over time or discuss native versus migratory bird species early and late arrivals to the UK. Within this section try to consult with the literature to assess whether what you found was expected. Source relevant scientific publications from web of science and Google scholar and include a reference list at the end of your portfolio. The latter will not be included in your word count. Refer to the DLS handbook for appropriate reference presentation. Example format: Week 1 (starting 12th of February 2024) Sunrise: Sunset: Temperature (Min): Temperature (Max): General weather conditions: wet and cloudy overcast week Birds heard singing (with location): for example - Chiffchaff (Penglais woods), Robin (Student village), Blue Tit (Town), Great Tit (Campus) Tree development states (with location): for example - Beech (Buds - Penglais woods), Oak (Buds- Penglais woods), Hazel (Buds- Penglais woods) – all dormant / 0% bud burst. Other observations: Week 2 (starting 19th of February 2024) Insert details Week 3 (starting 26th of February 2024) Insert details Week 4 (starting 4th of March 2024) Insert details Week 5 (starting 11th of March 2024) Insert details Synthesis: see above on what to include in this section. Page 3 of 4 Cyfadran y Gwyddorau Daear a Bywyd / Faculty of Earth and Life Sciences BSc for Written Work Other types of assessment may include lab reports, summaries, technical reports, case studies etc. While the criteria below are a guide, you should also check the details above for specific guidance on expectations. It is likely that your work will contain elements which match the criteria for more than one of the descriptions below. This will be reflected in the feedback you receive and your final mark. Marking criteria for final year dissertations will be provided separately at the appropriate time. Mark % Class FDSc Class BSc Criteria 90-100 Distinction 1 The work presented will be factually faultless and entirely focused on the task set. There will be excellent coverage and extensive evidence of supplementary reading. 80-89 Distinction 1 The work presented will be factually virtually faultless and clearly focused on the task set. There will be comprehensive coverage and good evidence of supplementary reading. 70-79 Distinction 1 The work will be factually correct and focused on the task set. There will be some evidence of outside reading and very good coverage and presentation. 60-69 Merit 2.1 The work will be a comprehensive attempt at the task i.e. factually sound, clear and logical. 50-59 Merit -------------- - 54 Pass 2.2 The work will be accurate but limited in depth or coverage. There may be some errors or key facts missing or misinterpreted. Presentation or organisation may hinder communication of the material. 40-49 Pass 3 Information will be sparse or inaccurate but broadly relevant to the question. The work will lack depth or coverage. Presentation or organisation will hinder communication of the salient material. 30-39 Fail Fail The work presented will be poorly directed at the question. There will be many omissions or errors but some relevant facts will be correct. The work will lack convincing demonstration of understanding. 20-29 Fail Fail The material will be largely irrelevant to the task set with many omissions and / or errors. Organisation will be poor. 10-19 Fail Fail The work will be lacking in length or irrelevant to the question. There will be little substance / factual material presented. 0-9 Fail Fail There will be almost no relevant / correct material included. Page 4 of 4","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
