Facilitation - Species in the sequence improve the environment for subsequent species. 2. Tolerance - Initial environment becomes less favorable for the species initially present, but no better nor worse for subsequent species. 3. Inhibition - Species present at any time inhibit the establishment or performance of subsequent species. Long lived species later out live others. Summary • Habitats are destroyed in a multitude of different ways by biological, human and natural causes • They recover by ‘succession’ which is the change in vegetation over time • ‘Primary succession’ is vegetation developing on new substrates • ‘Secondary succession’ is vegetation developing on partially developed substrates • There are three theories of succession (facilitation, tolerance, inhibition) References and acknowledgements: • Beeby, A. & Brennan, A.M.
