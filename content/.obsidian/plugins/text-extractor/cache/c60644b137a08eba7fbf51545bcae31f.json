Evidence for evolution Observable, homology, fossil record Observable evolution – artificial selection Human-induced “Natural Selection”Observable evolution – the peppered moth A prediction of common descent is phenotypic similarities between species © UC Museum of Paleontology Understanding Evolution, www.understandingevolution.org Analogous similarity explained by a shared way of life.. • sharks, dolphins and whales have a hydrodynamic shape. • insects, birds and bats have wings. Homologous similarities are not explained by functional needs • Fish in Devonian period that had six, seven, eight digited limbs. • There is no evidence that five digits have any selective advantage… • Thus, five digits is an evolutionary fluke, its retention suggesting a common ancestry. © UC Museum of Paleontology Understanding Evolution, www.understandingevolution.org Homologous similarities are not explained by functional needs Homology – vestigial structures Wisdom teeth Appendix Coccyx Goosebumps Images by Gordon Johnson and Clker-Free-Vector-Images from Pixabay Palmar grasp reflex Comparative Embryology Ernst Haeckel at his Zoological Institute in Jena, 1907 Homology – cellular level Plant Cell Vectors by Vecteezy nucleus ribosomes mitochondria cell membrane endoplasmic reticulum golgi apparatus nucleolus Homology – molecular level: The Universal Code, a “frozen accident” Some codons, do not code for anything (STOP codons).
