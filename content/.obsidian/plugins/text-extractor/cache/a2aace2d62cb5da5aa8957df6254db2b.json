{"path":"University/lecture slides/Ecology and Conservation/Populations.pdf","text":"Populations & population growth Objectives By the end of this lecture, you should understand: • The definition of a ‘population’ • ‘Life tables’ & ‘age pyramids’, and their applications • ‘Survivorship curves’ • Mechanisms of population growth with examples • ‘Carrying capacity’, ‘time lags’, and reasons for ‘population oscillations’ • ‘r and K selection’ • Arctic reindeer populations as a case study Populations are everywhere Populations of bryophytes & lichens A group of organisms of the same species occupying a particular space at a particular time North of Sweden: populations occur even in extreme conditions Humans also represent populations. This is an example of a closely-packed, dense population. At higher latitudes we still represent populations, but at greater distances from each other Static life tables Static life-table data, human female population of Canada, 1966 Age Group (yr) No. in each age group Deaths in each age group Mortality rate per 1000 population, 1000qz 0-1 189,208 3,822 20.2 1-4 879,408 775 0.88 5-9 1,128,036 480 0.43 10-14 1,022,258 318 0.31 15-19 908,767 467 0.51 20-24 734,183 403 0.55 25-29 622,332 384 0.62 30-34 611,199 564 0.92 35-39 636,375 845 1.33 40-44 632,319 1,293 2.04 45-49 547,163 1,823 3.33 50-54 489,981 2,434 4.97 55-59 402,911 3,115 7.73 60-64 333,404 4,064 12.19 65-69 276,771 5,393 19.49 70-74 228,399 7,063 30.92 75-79 161,398 8,695 53.87 80-84 96,655 9,048 93.61 85-over 59,769 10,964 183.44 Age pyramids Bottom portions represent pre-reproductive years (0-14), middle portions represent reproductive years (15-44) and top portions represent post-reproductive years (45-85+). (Data from Population Reference Bureau). Survivorship curves Hypothetical survivorship curves (After Pearl, 1928) Type 1: Most organisms die late in life. e.g. humans Type 2: Uniform rate of decline. e.g. birds Type 3: High mortality rate in young organisms. e.g. fish Survivorship curves (England and Wales) Population growth When the environment is favourable and resources not limiting, populations will undergo ‘exponential’ growth Logistic Exponential Autumn moth Population growth of North Atlantic Gannet, Southwestern Britain 0 5000 10000 15000 20000 25000Population Size Year Environmental variation Flour beetle populations - Tribolium confusum Genetic variation Flour beetle - Tribolium castaneum “The maximum population of a given organism that a particular environment can sustain” Carrying capacity a) Idealised S-shaped curve of population growth b) Overshoot and dieback occur when a rapidly expanding population temporarily overshoots ‘carrying capacity’ of its environment Time TimeNumber of individualsNumber of individualsCarrying capacity Population overshoots carrying capacity Population crash or dieback Initial carrying capacity New carrying capacity Carrying capacitySpenders r selected species • Variable • Density independent, catastrophes happen often. • Variable population that never stabilises and ignores carrying capacity • Survivorship curve – Type III • Usually lax Savers K selected species • More predictable • Density dependent, sustainable populations • Population constant, at equilibrium, near carrying capacity • Survivorship curve – Type I and II Time lags Population growth in the water flea Daphnia magna at (a) 18oC and (b) 25oC 18oC 25oC The Arctic Colder climates: The Arctic Arctic populations Reindeer populations in the Arctic Reindeer populations • Reindeer populations are a good example of population growth • In 1911, reindeer were introduced to two islands in Alaska • 4 males and 21 females were released on St. Paul Island • 3 males and 12 females were released on St George Island Reindeer population growth on the Pribilof Islands, Bering Sea, 1911-1950. 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500No. reindeerSt Paul St George Reindeer populationsSummary • Populations can be found everywhere, even in the most extreme environments • ‘Life tables’ and ‘age pyramids’ can be used to look at the age distributions of a population and to predict future distributions • There are three types of ‘survivorship curve’ relating to different life history strategies in different species • Population growth can be ‘exponential’ or ‘logistic’ depending on limitations of environment Summary • ‘Carrying capacity’: maximum population of a given organism that a particular environment can sustain • Species can be ‘r’ (high productivity) or ‘K’ (high efficiency) selected • Populations can be monitored over time (e.g. reindeer in the Arctic) References and acknowledgements: • Kruuk, H.
