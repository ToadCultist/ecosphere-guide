It involves the production of a large format poster summarising a particular research topic using text, diagrams and images. At a conference the researcher often stands by their poster and gives a short (~5 minute) pre-prepared “Elevator Pitch” oral presentation to a small audience. Poster presentations are a great way to develop your skills as they combine the need to research, summarise and talk about scientific topics. For this assignment you will be preparing an electronic poster. To simulate the experience of presenting your poster you are required to upload your poster with a 5-minute recorded podcast presentation as if you were presenting it at a scientific meeting. Poster Topics To complete your poster podcast, you must choose one of the following topics: Poster topic (each has a different submission point) Member of staff Date where topic is first introduced Single-celled eukaryotes Haze 3/10/23 The history of cell biology Haze 3/10/23 Protein function is determined by DNA structure: what could possibly go wrong? Huw 5/10/23 The benefits of compartmentalisation Maurice 17/10/23 Utilizing plant cell walls for the bioeconomy Maurice 24/10/23 How cells communicate Huw 26/10/23 Obtaining energy from a high protein diet Dave 21/11/23 The Cori cycle Dave 21/11/23 Help and Guidance This workshop will cover the features of effective poster presentations. There is also the option of attending a Q&A drop-in session on Teams during reading week to ask questions about the assignment. There is guidance on researching topics and accessing support from our subject librarian via this link: https://libguides.aber.ac.uk/lifesciences Resources and Skills Required To complete this assessment you will need to be able to carry out the following tasks: 1. Decision-making – choosing a topic and selecting resources. 2. Use of web browsers to access websites to research the question topic. 3. Use of Library resources to acquire appropriate research material. 1 4. Use of software to produce your poster and audio recording. 5. Electronic submission of your poster podcast as a Blackboard Assignment Poster Podcast Requirements Poster Creation and Layout As students, you all have access to Microsoft PowerPoint and this is recommended for production of your poster but you can use other software that can export an MP4. If you decide to use different software, then the onus is on you to produce a suitable file. The poster can be portrait or landscape orientation and can be any size or shape. The design, layout and fonts must be clear and consistent when viewed on a computer screen with good contrast. Citing your sources Although the topics will all be introduced to you during the module (see Table in the “Poster Topics” section), the assignment will also involve independent research. Scientific writing requires that your text be supported by sources that you have researched. For the purposes of the Poster Podcast any consistent referencing style can be used. You should include in-text citations for sources from which you have drawn evidence or diagrams that you have used, and these sources should be listed at the bottom of your poster in the “References” section. This section can be in much smaller text than the rest of the text sections of your poster, as it’s not expected to be read from a distance. The key point is that the citations in the text should relate uniquely to an item in the References section, and the item should allow the reader to locate the source unambiguously. The source of any images that you use, unless you drew them yourself, must be cited. Recording your podcast After designing your “poster” element, you should practice and record your 5-minute “podcast” element. You can record this as an Audio Comment in PowerPoint. Alternatively, if you have already recorded an audio file and are happy with it, you can use Powerpoint to embed this: Insert > Audio > Record Audio (New Recording) OR Audio on my PC (Embed Existing Recording) > > 2 PLEASE NOTE: If the recording is longer than 5 minutes then the marker will stop listening when 5 minutes is reached, if it is much shorter then review whether you have provided enough information about your chosen topic. Save your work as an MP4 file by selecting File, Save As Check your MP4 recording to ensure that the sound quality is clear. If you do not have suitable equipment, headsets, lapel microphones or even laptops can be loaned from Information Services: https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/is/it-services/loans/ and IS also have various routes for you to get help and advice: https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/is/help/. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are able to record and submit your work by the deadline. Submitting your work When you are ready to submit your work, go to ‘Assessment and Feedback’ on Blackboardand folder is a folder that contains all of the submission points. Click on the Poster topic that you chose – each topic has a different submission link to facilitate marking by the appropriate staff member. Only submit to the submission point for the topic that you chose. 3 Click “Start attempt 1” (it will be a higher number if you’ve already submittted a draft, don’t worry about this, the last submitted attempt will be marked). Click in the submission box and it will change from this: to this: Click the + symbol on the right of the tool bar and select Additional Tools Then select the Panopto option 4 The screen will look like this Choose the upload option from the middle of the screen and drag the file to your browser window or click to browse and find it from your computer. Click ‘Insert’ at the bottom right of the screen: In the dialogue box, choose a suitable display name for your poster and press Insert. The screen will look like this. Press submit. 5 You will receive a digital receipt for the submission Please save the receipt as proof of submission.
