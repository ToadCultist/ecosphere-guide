(2010) Terrestrial gross carbon dioxide uptake. Science 329: 834-838 Vegetation fixes 123 billion tonnes carbon yearlyCarbon CYCLE • Most carbon fixed by plants is released back to the atmosphere via respiration • Only a small percentage is trapped, entering the longer geological cycles, e.g. formation of sedimentary rock • Fossil fuels – carbon trapped by past photosynthesis, now being released • 1.5-1.2 billion yrs ago • Molecular fundamentals of photosynthesis pre-date eukaryotic plants Endosymbiont origin of chloroplasts Monocot & Dicot Leaves Dicot netted veins Sunflower Helianthus annuus Maize Zea mays Monocot parallel veins Epidermis: lacks chloroplasts Palisade mesophyll: many chloroplasts Spongy mesophyll: large air spaces Sunflower leaf transverse section • Epidermis: • Convex surface focuses light • Mesophyll gets x 2-3 more intense light than falls on leaf Leaf structure amplifies incident light Palisade mesophyll: • Columnar cells channel light Leaf structure amplifies incident light Spongy mesophyll: • Air spaces scatter light • Increases time each photon spends in leaf • Photon density inside > outside leaf Leaf structure amplifies incident lightCO2 enters leaf via pores: ‘stomata’* CO2 in O2 & H2O out *plural, stoma singular Stomata on Leaf Surface Guard cells Subsidiary cells Stomatal pore Guard cells: thick walls Guard cell Guard cell Stomatal pore Subsidiary cell Stomata close when guard cells flaccid • Generally open in day, close at night • Regulated to conserve H2O: close in drought Summary of Photosynthesis • Equation: 6CO2 + 6H2O 6C6H12O6 + 6O2 • Photosynthesis is the ultimate source of all the food you eat and all the oxygen you breathe. Morris et al. (2016) ‘Calvin cycle’ Primary carbon fixation cycle • 3-carbon product of ‘Rubisco’(Ribulose-1,5- bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase), CO2- fixation enzyme Rubisco: • Carbon for life for 2.45 billion years • ~123 billion tonnes carbon per year • Most abundant protein on Earth Fixed carbon exported from mesophyll Symplastic route Apoplastic route • Source: photosynthate- exporting organ • Sink: photosynthate- importing organ Transport from ‘sources’ to ‘sinks’ Phloem is in vascular bundles Cortex Pith Cambium Epidermis Fibres Phloem Xylem Sunflower stem Helianthus annuus ‘Sieve tube elements’ in angiosperm phloem • Conducting cells: ‘sieve tube elements’ • Sieve tube element: no nucleus or mitochondria • End walls perforated → cytoplasmic connections between stacked cells (i.e. ‘tube’) • Each sieve tube element (SE) has companion cell (CC) • CC: nucleus and mitochondria • CC provides SE with proteins & energy for transport • CC connected by plasmodesmata (pores in wall) to SE ‘Companion cells’ in angiosperm phloemComposition of phloem sap from castor bean Sugars transported are ‘non-reducing’ • Reducing sugars (e.g. glucose) too reactive (can be oxidise) • Most common transported sugar is sucrose (non-reducing) • Others consist of • sucrose bound to galactose(s) • or non-reducing sugar alcohols • Sucrose accumulated against concentration gradient • Proton pumps generate H+ gradient by active transport • Sucrose driven across plasma membranes by cotransport with H+ ions Pressure-Flow Model ‘Loading’ • Phloem translocates sugars etc. from ‘sources’ to ‘sinks’ • At sources, sugars loaded into sieve tubes Pressure-Flow Model ‘Loading’ • Phloem translocates sugars etc. from ‘sources to sinks’ • At sources, sugars loaded into sieve tubes • Water follows by osmosis from source cells and xylem Pressure-Flow Model ‘Loading’ • Phloem translocates sugars etc. from ‘sources’ to ‘sinks’ • At sources, sugars loaded into sieve tubes • Water follows by osmosis from source cells and xylem • Pressure created Pressure-Flow Model ‘Loading’ Pressure-Flow Model ‘Unloading’ • At ‘sink’, sugars unloaded out of phloem • Water follows by osmosis • Phloem sap flows from high to low pressure • Flow-rate (~1 m h-1) faster than diffusion Phloem also transmits ‘signal’ molecules Day-length sensor in leaves → ‘FT protein’ FT moves in phloem to buds → flowering Summary • Leaf structure amplifies incident light • Leaf internal tissues include ‘palisade’ & ‘spongy mesophyll’ • CO2 enters & O2 & H2O exit via ‘stomata’ • Angiosperm ‘phloem’ has ‘sieve-tube elements’ with ‘companion cells’ • ‘Pressure-flow’ model for phloem transport from ‘sources’ to ‘sinks’ • Flowering signal moves in phloem Image acknowledgments Pexels, https://www.pexels.com Campbell & Reece (2008) Biology, 8th edn.
