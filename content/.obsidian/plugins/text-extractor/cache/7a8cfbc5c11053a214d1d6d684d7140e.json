An additional handout and video will be made available during this period that will contain more information about this report. The practical report will examine the ecological adaptations of three plant species to drought: Species: • Vicia faba (‘broad bean’) - a crop species with no special drought adaptations • Kalanchoë daigremontiana (‘synonym’ Bryophyllum daigremontianum) - a succulent ‘xerophyte’ from arid regions of Madagascar • Iris pseudacorus - an ‘emergent’ freshwater species found in local ditches and pools. The practical class will generate the date that will be analysed in this report Task-specific marking criteria The report MUST contain the following sections. Introduction: Give an overview of the area and clearly state your objectives in the final paragraph. Methods: Describe concisely but in sufficient detail how the work was conducted. You need to write out your own ‘Materials and Methods’ even if you followed the handout exactly. This should be presented in flowing paragraphs (do not use numbered or bullet pointed lists). Results: Present and analyse the data. It should contain at least one table and one figure. Text in the results should guide the reader through the data displayed by describing what they demonstrate but leaving in-depth interpretation to the discussion. Figures need distinct legends that follows the diagram or graph stating their content without interpretation. Tables require a brief title that appears before the actual table. Discussion: Review of the results in the context of existing knowledge. Try to comment on any limitations in experiment. References: should be consistently formatted following a recognised convention (e.g. APA). Pay attention to the following details, which are common sources of lost marks: • Use correct Latin name spelling and formats: Genus species. • Use clear English and correct spelling. • Describe experiments in past tense. • Avoid common confusion about spelling \"its\" and \"it's\" - and \"affect\" v. \"effect\". • Avoid colloquial contractions (that's, don't, isn't, etc.). • Never say \"you\", “I” or “we” in scientific reports. • Do not present the same data in both figures & tables. • All references in list at end should be cited at least once in the text. References in text should be cited in list at end. • Do not use bullets or numbering anywhere.
