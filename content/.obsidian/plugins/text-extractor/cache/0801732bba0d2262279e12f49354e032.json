Major factors in increasing yields during the green revolution: • Crop improvement • Fertiliser application • Mechanisation • Irrigation • Use of pesticides Global fertiliser use • Global nitrogen fertiliser consumption increased 950% and global phosphate fertiliser consumption increased 380% from 1961 to 2013 (Lu and Tian, 2017). Collapse of the Soviet Union and the reduction in state subsidised fertiliser applications Key plant nutrients include Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P) and Potassium (K) Use of pesticides to reduce competition/pressure on crops The main pesticides include: • herbicides (effective against plants) • Insecticides (effective against insects) • Fungicides (effective against fungal infections) Photocredit: Jeff Vanuga/NRCS (http://www.publicdomainfiles.com/show_file.php?id=1339361281 9686) Max Roser (2017) – ‘Fertilizer and Pesticides’.

Organic agricultural systems generally have: • no pesticide or fertiliser inputs • limited medicinal inputs for livestock • Yields range from 5-34% lower than conventional systems Comparing organic and conventional yields Seufert et al, 2012 Precision farming • Precise application of nutrients, pesticides and water can minimise inputs whilst maximising outputs and reducing negative environmental impacts By Susan Moran, Landsat 7 Science Team and USDA Agricultural Research Service (U.S. Government work) - earthobservatory.nasa.gov (NASA Earth Observatory, Image of the Day 2001-01-30 \"Precision Farming\"), Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=10747279 NASA – http://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/education/teacherkit/images /landsat7sat.gif, Avalik omand, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=1941 194 https://pixabay.com/en/drone-uav-remote-control-aircraft- 784310/ Precision farming https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhqNmR uBPsw https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASZAf2n8 HLs Urban agriculture - Hydroponics Definition of Hydroponics “The process of growing plants in sand, gravel or liquid with added nutrients but without soil”. Oxford dictionary There has been a recent resurgence of interest in urban agriculture and hydroponics in particular. Some of the benefits are clear – growing close to consumption (e.g. in old subway tunnels under London) but the sustainability of using artificial light sources is still to be answered definitively. Key Points • The development of agriculture allowed the development of the first societies • Agriculture is now the dominant human land use on the planet • Agricultural intensification has brought, and will continue to bring, many environmental challenges • It is likely that we will need to sustainably intensify in the future to feed a growing world population • Without modern agriculture 7 billion people would currently not be alive","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
