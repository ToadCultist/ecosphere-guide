The ability of a solute to cross the plasma membrane is determined by several factors including size, charge and polarity (specifically the degree to which it forms H bonds with water). If an erythrocyte is placed in a solution of an ion or compound which cannot cross the plasma membrane and which is less concentrated (hypotonic) than the cell contents, water will enter the cell by osmosis and the cell will eventually burst (called haemolysis). Cells placed in solutions which have the same (isotonic) or greater (hypertonic) concentrations than the cell contents will not burst. Remember that osmosis depends on the total concentration of all solutes on each side of the membrane. Some solutes are able to cross the membrane more readily than others. They cross by passive diffusion, moving down their concentration gradient. Remember that diffusion is specific to an individual solute. The diffusion of ethanol (for example) across the plasma membrane is determined solely by the concentration difference in ethanol on either side of the membrane. It will be unaffected by the concentration difference of other solutes (e.g. glucose). This is fundamentally different to osmosis and understanding this difference is the key to interpreting the results in this practical. Safety Information: Please Read BEFORE Starting Work  There is a risk of toxoplasmosis caused by infection with a parasite (Toxoplasma gondii) that can be carried in sheep’s blood. This disease is particularly serious for pregnant woman and for those who are immunocompromised. Students who are pregnant (or suspect they may be) or who are immunocompromised must not participate in this practical. All others must wear gloves, lab coats, eye protection and avoid skin/eye contact with sheep’s blood.  Do not mouth pipette or risk mouth contact with any reagents.  Wash hands thoroughly after handling and before you leave the laboratory.  The toxicity of many research chemicals is unknown – all should be treated with care.  In the absence of conclusive evidence to the contrary always treat biological material as potentially infectious or toxic and all reagents as potentially very harmful.  Clean up spills on the bench or floor as soon as they happen disposing of towels, tissues etc. in the appropriate place.  Keep your work area tidy  If you spill reagents on yourself, unless otherwise instructed, rinse the affected area and, if biological in origin, gently swab the area with disinfectant. Report the incident to a member of staff/demonstrator.  If you get a reagent in your eye seek assistance from staff/demonstrator immediately.  If you cut or injure yourself seek assistance from staff/demonstrator immediately  Never fool around in the lab or misuse the reagents or equipment.  Never distract others whilst they are working – wait until they have finished  Make sure you know how to use equipment and concentrate whilst working Wear gloves and lab coats at all times. Eating and drinking in the lab is strictly forbidden. Wash your hands before leaving the lab. Dispose of blood and solutions in the waste container provided. Be aware of cross contamination – never use a pipette tip in more than one solution and never pour unused solutions back into the stock bottles. Materials (for all parts of the practical)  Defibrinated sheep blood  Pipette & tips  Disposable Pasteur pipettes  36 x 15ml plastic capped Falcon tubes 1  Test tube racks  Distilled water wash bottle  Waterproof marker pen  2 x 50ml plastic beakers (for accessing stock solutions)  ‘Waste-pot’ for disposal of solutions, pipettes and tips  Safety glasses and disposable gloves  Stopwatch Materials (for parts 1 and 2)  1 mol.dm-3 CaCl2  1.25 mol.dm-3 sucrose In this practical you will be working in groups of three Part 1: Control Purpose: To confirm that the method used is able to detect haemolysis. 1a. Set up 2 tubes as follows: A contains 5 ml distilled water and B contains 4 ml distilled water and 1 ml 1 mol.dm -3 CaCl2 (final concentration 0.2 mol.dm-3). Add 4 drops of blood to each tube, screw on the caps and mix by inversion. Leave both tubes for 5 minutes and then place each tube over printed text in your schedule. If you can see the print through the solution, haemolysis has occurred. Part 2: Determination of haemolysing concentrations of two solutes Purpose: To determine the concentrations of two different solutes which are isotonic with erythrocyte cytosol. 2a. Prepare two concentration series, one with CaCl2 and another with sucrose. Each tube will have a final volume of 5 ml and contain CaCl2 or sucrose at the following concentrations 0.50, 0.45, 0.40, 0.35, 0.30, 0.25, 0.20, 0.15, 0.10, 0.05, 0.02, and 0 mol.dm-3 (12 tubes for each compound). The table below shows the amount of stock CaCl 2 and water you need for each concentration, but you need to work this out for yourself for sucrose. Record your dilutions for sucrose in the worksheet at the end of this schedule. 2b. When you have made all the dilutions add 4 drops of blood to each tube and mix by gentle shaking and then leave to stand for 5 minutes. 2c. For each solute, record the lowest concentration at which the erythrocytes remain intact (no haemolysis) and the highest concentration at which haemolysis occurs. Record your results in the worksheet at the end of this schedule. The following is an example of the dilution series for CaCl2. You will need to work out the other series (sucrose) for yourself. Concentration (mol.dm-3) 0.50 0.45 0.40 0.35 0.30 0.25 0.20 0.15 0.10 0.05 0.02 0.0 Water (ml) 2.5 2.75 3.0 3.25 3.5 3.75 4.0 4.25 4.5 4.75 4.90 5.0 1 mol.dm-3 CaCl2 (ml) 2.5 2.25 2.0 1.75 1.5 1.25 1.0 0.75 0.5 0.25 0.10 0.0 Materials (Part 3) Safety Information. Thiourea is potentially carcinogenic to users and dangerous to a foetus. It can give off vapour. For that reason the stock is kept in the fume cupboard and must not be removed from there. Work in the fume cupboard until you have dispensed thiourea into tubes which should then be capped before taking them to the bench. When adding blood do so quickly recapping the tubes immediately after.  0.32 mol.dm-3 urea  0.32 mol.dm-3 ethylene glycol 2  0.32 mol.dm-3 glycerol  0.32 mol.dm-3 ethanol  0.32 mol.dm-3 thiourea Part 3: Rate of Permeation Before starting, rinse the test tubes thoroughly. Purpose: To determine the permeability of erythrocyte membranes to different solutes by measuring the time taken for haemolysis to occur. 3a. Add 5 ml of 0.32 mol.dm-3 urea to a test tube, add 4 drops of blood and mix. Start the stop watch. Determine the length of time (in seconds) it takes for haemolysis to occur. Repeat this for the other five solutions. If haemolysis has not occurred within 5 minutes you can move on to the next solution, checking any tubes that do not yet show haemolysis every minute. If haemolysis has not occurred within 15 minutes, assume that it is not going to occur at all. 3b. Repeat this process three times in total recording the results below. Things to think about  If you found a difference between the approximate isotonic concentrations of CaCl 2 and sucrose how would you account for this?  Work out a simple, easy to remember, and universally applicable way of calculating the volumes needed for dilutions  What gradient drives the movement of a non-ionic solvent, and how does this differ from the diffusion of an ion (assume that channels are provided for their movement in the membrane).  If we are interested in permeability of solutes, why are we testing for haemolysis?  What factors determine whether or not a solute is freely permeable across a plasma membrane?  If the solute is not freely permeable, how might it still enter the cell?  In part 3 you have three replicates for each solute. The mean summarises these three values, but how might you summarise the variation between the three numbers in a standard way?  Think about your organisation of your work in this practical. How might you have done things more efficiently?  Imagine that you had been dealing with toxic chemicals. Would the precautions you took (and the way you conducted yourselves) be adequate. What else might you have needed to do? Using a Pipette 1. Pipettes are expensive, please treat them with care. Never force moving parts. Do not allow the pipette to come into contact with reagents. 2. When you have taken up liquid into the tip always hold the pipette vertically with the tip pointing down. Holding it any other way can allow liquid to enter the body of the pipette potentially doing considerable damage to the device. 3. Pipettes work by raising and lowering a piston in a barrel to draw up and expel liquid. The piston is operated by pushing down on a plunger on top of the pipette and allowing it return to its original position. 4. When pushing the plunger you will feel resistance (first stop), you can push the plunger beyond this point of resistance until it will not move any further (second stop). 5. Fix a pipette tip firmly to the end of your pipette. A loose tip will not draw up the correct volume and may drop off. Once used, a tip may inadvertently transfer a small amount of one solution to another contaminating it. Always use a new tip when changing solutions. 3 Figure 4a Figure 4b Figure 4c Figure 4d 6. Press the pipette plunger down to the first stop and whilst holding it down (figure 4a) dip the tip into the solution. Keep the pipette vertical and the meniscus (surface) of the solution horizontal. 7. Slowly allow the plunger to return to its starting position (figure 4b). Do this in a controlled way by gently relaxing the pressure on the plunger. Do not allow the plunger to suddenly spring back as this can cause the liquid in the tip to boil risking contamination of the pipette and affecting the volume taken up. 8. Position the tip in the tube which receiving the solution. Ensure that the end of the tip is in contact with a clean part of the tube wall (figure 4c). If there is already liquid in the tube do not dip the tip into the liquid. Gently push the plunger down past the first stop and all the way to the second stop. This should eject all of the liquid (figure 4d). ‘Tips’ for tricky liquids Some liquids pose a problem when using pipettes. Viscous liquids (e.g. glycerol) can be handled by snipping off the very end of the pipette tip to make the hole larger. Detergents and foamy liquids can be difficult to expel completely. One trick is to blot the tip (if you are going to reuse it) against some clean tissue paper, before allowing the plunger to return to its starting position, to remove the bubbles. Watch out for bubbles when using foamy liquids, they can seriously affect the volume taken up. Some liquids (some organic solvents for example) are not retained by the tip when the plunger is raised. This can sometimes be overcome by drawing up and expelling the liquid a few times as if you were coating the inside of the tip with the liquid. 4 Red Cell Permeability Worksheet To be completed during the practical and retained by you Part 1 Haemolysis occurred in which solution? ______________________ Part 2 Dilutions for sucrose solutions Concentration (mol.dm-3) 0.50 0.45 0.40 0.35 0.30 0.25 0.20 0.15 0.10 0.05 0.02 0.0 Water (ml) 1.25M sucrose (ml) Solute Lowest concentration (mol.dm-3) at which there was no haemolysis Highest concentration (mol.dm- 3) at which haemolysis occurred Approximate concentration (mol.dm-3) isotonic with red cell contents CaCl2 Sucros e Part 3 Enter the time (in seconds) taken for haemolysis to occur in the following 0.32 M solutions Solute Time (s) Rpt1 Time (s) Rpt1 Time (s) Rpt1 Mean (s) Urea Ethylene glycol Glycerol Ethanol Thiourea 5","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":""}
