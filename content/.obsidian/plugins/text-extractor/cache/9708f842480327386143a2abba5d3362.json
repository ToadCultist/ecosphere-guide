Early designations (late nineteenth century) • Wildlife sanctuaries/refuges • To protect wildlife • Nature monuments/reserves • To protect landscapes • Wilderness areas • Specifically to protect wild landscapes (mainly USA) • Country/State parks • To protect open spaces • Game reserves, forest reserves, watershed protection forests • To protect natural resources National Parks • Alignment of nature conservation with efforts to boost national identity • E.g. to redefine post-colonial identity (UK) • By designating rural landscapes close to urban areas More recent national designations • Site of special scientific interest (SSSI) • Created by UK government in 1949 • Could be applied to any area of land • inside or outside pre-existing protected area • Including land used for other purposes (e.g. agriculture) International designations • UNESCO Convention on Wetlands (1971) • Invited countries to designate wetlands on international importance • UNESCO World Heritage Convention (1972) • Invited countries to propose World Heritage Sites • Many countries proposed existing national parks • Serengeti (Kenya) • Uluru (Australia) • Yosemite (USA) • Some countries used designation as a tool to conserve cultural landscapes • Jurassic Coast (UK) • EU Birds Directive (1979) and Habitats Directive (1992) • Require member states to designate • Special Protection Areas (SPA) • Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) Degrees of protection • Proposed • Described in official government strategies • Designated • Boundaries officially mapped • Legally binding land use plan • Gazetted • Enclosure of reserve • Erection of fences or boundary markers • Consultation with local people ‘Paper parks’ • Exist in official documents and reports • No effective management • Physical reality is no different to unprotected site IUCN Categories • 1a Strict Nature Reserve • Managed mainly for Science • 1b Wilderness area • Managed mainly for wilderness protection • 2 National Park • Managed mainly for ecosystem protection and recreation • 3 Natural Monument • Managed mainly for conservation of specific natural features • 4 Habitat/species management area • Managed mainly for conservation • Through management intervention • 5 Protected landscape/seascape • Managed mainly for landscape/seascape conservation and recreation • 6 Managed resource protected area • Managed mainly for sustainable use of natural Ecosystems Questions • Who should manage protected areas? • How should decisions be taken? State management • E.g. Kruger National Park, South Africa • Managed by SANParks (Government Agency) • Aims to make the park more relevant to the black majority • Works with Universities to develop adaptive management strategy • People and Conservation Directorate • Aims to bring together • Communities surrounding the park • wider South African public • Joint management forum • Aims to involve local communities in decision-making Multi-actor management • E.g. Indigenous Protected Areas (IPAs), Australia • Government identified areas of highest priority for conservation • Many were owned by indigenous Australians • Dialogue between conservationists and indigenous land owners • Identified many common aspirations • Indigenous group • Voluntarily declares IPA • Co-designs management plan with state conservation agencies Community Management • E.g. Conservancy areas (Namibia) • Local community has exclusive rights to manage wildlife resources • Incentive to manage them sustainably • External conservation organisations (e.g. WWF) • Provide technical support and training Private management • Private reserves • Land is purchased or leased by • conservation organisation • E.g. National Trust, RSPB • Wealthy individual • E.g. Paul Lister • Reserve manager • Prepares management plan • In consultation with statutory agencies • Free to innovate and engage with the wider public • Often unpopular with local communities and/or governments • Especially where foreign-owned • Perceived as undermining traditional rights and/or sovereignty","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
