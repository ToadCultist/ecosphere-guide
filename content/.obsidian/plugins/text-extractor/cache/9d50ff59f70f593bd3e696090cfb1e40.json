Chordata Subphylum Tunicata Subphylum Cephalochordata Myxinodes Chondrichthyes Aves Eutheria… Ancestral Deuterostome Protostomes Echinodermata Hemichordata (Cavalier-Smith, 1998)  Phylum Echinodermata • Echinodermata (Gk. echinos – spiny, derma – skin). • 7,300 spp. majority are marine; 15,000 extinct spp. • Includes sea lilies, starfish, brittlestars, sea urchins, sea cucumbers and sea daisies. Phylum Echinodermata • Characteristics: pentraradial symmetry, water vascular cavity, catch tissue, complex gut, nervous system, lacks excretory organs, calcareous ossicles (or plates) forming an endoskeleton or test, lack a differentiated head etc. • Larvae bilaterally symmetrical. Phylum Echinodermata Anatomy • Anus is located dorsally (aboral surface) and mouth ventrally (oral surface). • Cardiac stomach – can be everted. • Pyloric stomach branches to from the pyloric caeca. • Papulae. • Madreporite. • Pedicellariae. Chordata Subphylum Tunicata Subphylum Cephalochordata Myxinodes Chondrichthyes Aves Eutheria… Ancestral Deuterostome Protostomes Echinodermata Hemichordata (Cavalier-Smith, 1998)   Phylum Hemichordata • Halfway house between the phyla Echinodermata and the Chordata. • Characteristics: bilaterally symmetrical, with pharyngotremy, open circulatory system, complete complex gut etc. • Lack a notochord but they have a dorsal hollow nerve chord. The Notochord • In vertebrate chordates it ultimately becomes the site of the (calcified) vertebral column. • Notochord is a dorsal flexible rod of tissue derived from the embryonic mesoderm. • It plays a role in organising the development of the embryo. Stemple 2005. Structure and function of the notochord: an essential organ for chordate development. Development, 132: 2503-2512. KINGDOM: ANIMALIA Phylum Chordata • This taxon comprises of two subphyla that lack true backbones:  Subphylum Cephalochordata – the lancelets.  Subphylum Urochordata – tunicates. • Also includes the subphylum Vertebrata…. Phylum Chordata • Chordata (L. chorda – chord). • Characteristics: bilaterally symmetrical, pharyngeal gill slits present, notochord present, dorsal hollow nerve chord, complex gut, postanal tail, pharyngeal endostyle (homologous to the thyroid gland in vertebrates), circulatory system with heart or contractile blood vessels, tadpole larva present etc. Subphylum Urochordata (Tunicata) • Colonial, solitary or pelagic. Subphylum Urochordata (Tunicata) • Class Ascidiacea. • Sessile filter feeders. • Large pharynx with gill slits (stigmata). • Endostyle secretes a mucus net – rich in iodine. • Heart. Subphylum Urochordata (Tunicata) • Produce pelagic “tadpole” larvae which undergo metamorphosis to change into the sessile adult. • Notochord present but degenerates after metamorphosis. • Nerve chord forms the cerebral ganglion. Subphylum Cephalochordata • Gk. cephala – head; chordata – chord. • Notochord is present in the adult. • Myotomal muscle arrangement. • Postanal tail but lack vertebrae and a brain. • E.g. Branchiostoma lanceolatum. • Mucus nets are used to capture particles. • Closed circulatory system but no heart. • Protonephridia.
