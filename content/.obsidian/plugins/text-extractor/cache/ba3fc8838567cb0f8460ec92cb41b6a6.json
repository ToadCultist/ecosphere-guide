Communication between cells Read: Campbell et al. Chapter 9.1 – 9.4 (pages 214 - 230) Morris et al. Chapter 9 (pages 179 - 197) BR17520 Cell Biology Prof Huw D Jones hdj2@aber.ac.uk Learning outcomes: Understand: • Cells communicate by sending and receiving chemical signals. • Signalling molecules activate receptors on the cell-surface or inside the cell. • Structure and function of different classes of receptors with examples Receptors for intracellular signalling Steps in intracellular Signaling The signal binds to a cell- surface (or cytoplasmic) receptor, which is then activated. Plasma membrane The signal is transmitted within the cell by a signal transduction pathway. The cell responds, for example by activating an enzyme or turning on transcription of a gene. The response is terminated and the system reset so that new signals can be received. Receptor activation Signal transduction Response Termination Extracellular fluid Cytoplasm Plasma membrane of target cell Receptor Peptide hormones Peptide and amine hormones and many other ligands use cell-surface receptors Alternative terminology for signalling molecule: Hormone Ligand Messenger Signal Small hydrophobic ligands inc. steroid hormones use intracellular receptors Steroid hormone New protein mRNA Receptor protein Nucleus DNA Hormone-receptor complex Often the effect is to up– or down-regulate gene transcription Focus on cell-surface receptors • Three Types of Cell-Surface Receptors • G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) • Enzyme-linked receptors (Receptor kinases) • Ligand-controlled Ion channels G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) Inactive Ligand Receptor G protein Classified by having 7 transmembrane spanning domains And linking with heterotrimeric G protein within the cell. • G protein-coupled receptors are found in all eukaryotic organisms. • G protein-coupled receptors span the cell membrane 7 times and associate with G proteins in the cytoplasm. • Over 1000 types of GPCRs in humans (some are hormone receptors [eg adrenergic receptor], others detect light, smell, taste, some are neurotransmitters). • 25 – 30% of all modern therapeutic drugs act on GPCR or G proteins. • When a ligand binds to a G protein-coupled receptor, the receptor binds to and activates the G protein which in turn starts an intracellular signalling cascade. GPCR Facts G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) Inactive Active Ligand Receptor G protein Ligand Receptor Inactive target protein maybe membrane-bound or free in cytoplasm Inactive G protein b g a GDP When the a subunit is bound to GDP, the three subunits are joined together and the G protein is inactive. G Protein system in inactive state Alpha unit has GDP not GTP GDP = Guanosine di-phosphate GTP = Guanosine tri-phosphate When the G protein is associated with an activated receptor, the GDP bound to the a subunit is replaced by GTP, which leads to separation of the three subunits and the free alpha unit initiates a response. Chemical signal / ligand binds to GPCR. Conformational change in GRCR stimulates binding and activation (GTP) of α subunit Activated α subunit splits for other subunits and binds to target protein. Response Active target protein GDP GTP GTP a b g ab g G Protein Activation Inactive target proteinWatch this video of G-protein receptor activation (1 min 48 sec) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xT0mAQ4726s Watch this video (3 min 23 sec) that supports the idea that many therapeutic drugs in use today target GPCRs or their heterotrimeric G proteins https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NL_YbPigDzg The ‘Slime mould’ Dictyostelium uses a GPCR to detect an aggregation signal (cyclic AMP) when the colony is lacking food. The detection of this starvation signal causes the single-celled (mixamoebae) to aggregate into a multicellular slug which can move to a new food source Slime mould Dictyostelium also uses a simple form of G protein signalling to switch between single & multicellular living and escape starvation. Dictyostelium exists as single celled myxamoebae and multicellular forms. GPCRs in the free-living myxamoebae detect the signal cAMP and cause them to aggregate into a multicellular ‘slug’. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h8WOWEqP6o Watch the video of Dictostelium as they switch between single-celled, free-living and multicellular ‘slug’ forms. The transition between forms is initiated by the signalling molecule cyclic AMP which is detected by GPCRs on the cell surface of the myxamoeba (3 min 39 sec) www.Pinterest The responding cells are in many different organs: heart, lungs, skin, pancreas etc. Adrenalin / epinephrine activates ‘adrenergic receptors’ in heart, lungs, skin etc to supress ‘housekeeping’ activities of the body and prepare it for action. Adrenergic receptors are G-protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) Enzyme linked receptor eg Receptor kinase Phosphate group Inactive Active Insulin Receptor is an example of a receptor kinase (specifically tyrosine kinase) insulin The insulin-bound receptor activates a kinase enzyme which in turn stimulates glucose transporters to take up glucose into the cell For illustration only. Details of signal cascade not needed! Ligand-controlled ion channel (AKA: ligand gated, ligand regulated) Ions Inactive Active Other types of ion channels can be regulated by voltage Example of ligand-controlled ion channel is acetylcholine receptor in post-synaptic membrane of a neuromuscular junction https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLS84OoHJnQ Acetylcholine binds to the receptor. Channel opens. Na ions (orange circles) flow through the membrane to initiate next action potential in neurone. 1. Ion Channel Receptor 2. Na Ions 3. Ligand (eg. acetylcholine) Watch the video of the neuromuscular junction and how acetylcholine triggers an excitation potential in post-synaptic membranes via ligand-gated ion channels (3 min 18 sec) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WORIhbaRABg Watch the video for a nice summary of the different types of membrane- bound and cytoplasmic hormone receptors (2 min 27 sec) Intracellular receptors Steroid hormone Eg. oestrogen Eg. Steroid hormones such as oestrogen If the pancreas cannot make enough insulin: Type 1 diabetes I used homeostatic regulation of blood glucose by insulin and glucagon as an example of hormones in the endocrine system. If the target cells fail to respond correctly (Impaired intracellular signalling): Type 2 diabetes But what happens when sugar homeostasis fails? - Diabetes Types 1 or 2Type II diabetes is caused by ‘insulin resistance’ where the responding cells lose their ability to detect insulin and fail to absorb sufficient glucose from the blood Type I diabetes is caused by the pancreas not making sufficient insulin but the responding cells are still able to detect insulin normally. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbwRYFMPZS4 Watch the two videos of type II diabetes and the insulin receptor (3 min 57 sec and 3 min 45 sec respectively) Understand the concept of ‘insulin resistance’ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAjZv41iUJU","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
