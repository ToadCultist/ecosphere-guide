A brief history of evolutionary biology Aristotle and essentialism 350 BC • Qualitative view of nature • First classification – blooded vertebrates and bloodless invertebrates • Scala naturae – natural ladder • Species never change Essentialism Species themselves are fixed into place and are unable to move up (or down) the scale of nature. In the sense of essentialism, transmutation is therefore not possible. Carl von Linné (Linnaeus) • Binomial classification to encompass variation • Systema Naturae 1735 • Classes, orders, genera and species • 10th edition classified 4400 species of animals and 7700 species of plants 1753 Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and transformism 1809 • Lineages of species do not go extinct, but change from one form to another • Internal forces • Inheritance of acquired characteristics • Continuous, gradual change Geology gives evolutionary thinking more TIME Georges Cuvier and catastrophism • Added phyla to Linnaeus classification • Species have gone extinct • Through catastrophic events like floods • Biostratigraphy – age of rocks and fossils • Comparative anatomy 1813 Georges Cuvier and catastrophism Quarries of the Paris Basin (1) The first and uppermost layer, contained many fossils of animals and plants characteristic of lakes and freshwater marshes. 2) The second layer (sandstone), at places more than 80 feet in thickness, sandstone. The fossils consisted mainly of marine organisms. 3) The third layer consisted of gypsum and limestone and the fossils appeared to be of freshwater species. 4) The fourth layer consisted of a coarse-grained limestone, mainly marine fossils but with a few freshwater forms. 5) The fifth and lowest layer; chalk, clay and sand. The fossils were freshwater shells and driftwood. Charles Lyell and uniformitarianism • Principles of Geology • Small changes over time lead to state of the Earth • Stratigraphy of the Tertiary period • Law of Supposition • Opposed catastrophism 1830s Events such as erosion and earthquakes, which create changes within the present are the same processes which have existed within the past and occurred at the same gradual rate as they do within the present. Charles Darwin and natural selection • Voyage on the Beagle to the Galapagos islands (1831) • Forms better adapted to survive will reproduce and pass on their fitness • Evolution is not inherently progressive • On the Origin of Species (1859) • NO understanding of genetics 1832-37 1859 Gregor Mendel and heredity • Hybridization using pea plants (1860s) • Traits are determined by heritable factors • Theory of heredity rediscovered by William Bateson, Hugo de Vries and Carl Correns (1900 – 1920s) 1920s Modern synthesis • RA Fisher, JBS Haldane and Sewall Wright • Merging Darwin’s natural selection with Mendel’s theory of heredity • Theoretical population genetics 1930s Genetic field research 1940s • Theodosius Dobzhansky – evolution in fruit flies (Drosophila) • EB Ford – natural selection in moths • HBD Kettlewell – melanism in peppered moths • Speciation – how one species splits into two • Define species by the ability to interbreed Early thinkers Darwin Modern A timeline of evolutionary biology 1832-37 Charles Darwin’s voyage on the Beagle Aristotle and essentialism – species are fixed 350 BC 1753 Carl von Linné and binomial classification Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and transformism – species change over time and inheritance of acquired characters 1809 1813 Georges Cuvier and catastrophism – species have gone extinct Charles Lyell and uniformitarianism – Earth’s processes and stratigraphy 1830s Publication of Darwin’s On the Origin of Species and natural selection 1859 1865-1920s Gregor Mendel and heredity RA Fisher, JBS Haldane and Sewall Wright and population genetics 1930s 1940s Theodosius Dobzhansky, EB Ford, HBD Kettlewell and field research","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
