Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in biology DOI:10.1101/cshperspect.a030288 cytoskeleton BR17520 8 Virtually all eukaryotic cells, including plant cells, have a cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton is the intracellular filament system that controls the shape of the cell and allows the cell to organize its internal components and to move. It also provides trafficking routes for intracellular transport. The Cytoskeleton: Structure and Function BR17520 9 The Cytoskeleton: visualization BR17520 The Cytoskeleton: visualization BR17520 The Cytoskeleton: “bones” and “muscles” 11 The cytoskeleton is a highly dynamic structure that continuously reorganizes as a cell changes shape, divides, and responds to its environment. http://cellmolecularbiologyblog.blogspot.com/2015/03/cytoskeleton.html Responsible for large-scale movements, including crawling of cells along a surface, the contraction of muscle cells etc. BR17520 12 The Cytoskeleton: Three types The cytoskeleton consists of three major components each with a different structure, composed of different proteins, and performing a different set of functions. Ø 10 nm Ø 25 nm Ø 7 nm All eukaryotesSome animals BR17520 13 The Cytoskeleton: Intermediate Filaments  Abundant in animals cells that require a lot of strength, e.g. nerve cell axons, muscle cells and in epithelial cells such as those in the skin  Intermediate filaments have great tensile strength  Toughest and most durable of the cytoskeletal filaments  Enables cells to withstand mechanical stress when they are stretched  Typically form a network throughout the cytoplasm  They are often anchored to the plasma membrane at cell-cell junctions called desmosomes https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Figure_04_05_01.jpg BR17520 14 The Cytoskeleton: Intermediate Filaments Intermediate filaments are like ropes made of long, twisted strands of proteinsoluble Intermediate filaments have NO polarity BR17520 15 The Cytoskeleton: Intermediate Filaments  Every type of epithelium in the vertebrate body (e.g. tongue, the cornea, or the lining of the gut) has its own distinctive mixture of keratin proteins (a diverse family of more than 50 members).  Specialized keratins also occur in hair, feathers, and claws. The cytoskeleton consists of three major components each with a different structure, composed of different proteins, and performing a different set of functions. Ø 10 nm Ø 25 nm Ø 7 nm 16 BR17520 The Cytoskeleton: Three types 17 BR17520 The Cytoskeleton: Microtubules Two major categories – cytoplasmic and axonemal (associated with cilia and flagella) Functions include:  Maintain shape (e.g. axons)  Maintain cell polarity (e.g. during movement)  Transport and positioning of membrane enclosed organelles within the cell  Guiding intracellular transport of various cytosolic macromolecules  Form the mitotic spindle  Regulate cellulose deposition in plant cell walls Image: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetochore Image: http://fluoview.magnet.fsu.edu/gallery/cells/gelu/geluexlarge1.html  Microtubules are hollow tubes with structurally distinct ends  Tubes formed from dimers of two glubular proteins: α and β tubulin  Microtubules have a definite structural polarity with a designated plus and minus end  Tubulin dimers add more rapidly to the plus end than to the minus end  The polarity is crucial for their assembly and function 18 BR17520 Microtubules: Structure  Microtubules grow from specialized organizing centres that control the location, number and orientation of the microtubules  The Centrosome, the major MTOC in animal cells, organizes an array of microtubules that radiates outward through the cytoplasm  Centrosome matrix contains ring like structures formed by γ- tubulin; each γ-tubulin ring complex serves as the nucleation site for the growth of one microtubule  Minus end embedded in the centrosome and growth only occurring at the plus end that extends into the cytoplasm  By providing organizing centres at specific sites, and keeping the concentration of free αβ-tubulin dimers low, cells can control where microtubules form 19 BR17520 The Microtubule-organizing Centre (MTOC) Dynamic instability: switching back and forth between polymerization and depolymerization This allows microtubules to undergo rapid remodelling and is crucial for their function Plus ends can be stabilized by binding to specific proteins (e.g. capping proteins) Selective stabilization of microtubules can polarize a cell 20 BR17520 Microtubules display dynamic instability 21 Free tubulin dimers contain one GTP molecule (red) tightly bound to β-tubulin, which hydrolyzes the GTP to GDP (dark green) shortly after the dimer is added to a growing microtubule GTP-associated dimers bind more strongly to their neighbours in the microtubule than do dimers that bear GDP. Thus the microtubule will continue to grow If the tubulin dimers at the free end of the microtubule will hydrolyse their GTP before the next dimers are added, the free ends will be composed of GDP-tubulin GDP-bearing dimers associate less tightly, tipping the balance in favour of disassembly 22 BR17520 Dynamic instability is driven by GTP-Hydrolysis 23 • Most differentiated animal cells are polarized; i.e. one end of the cell is structurally or functionally different from the other • The cells polarity is a reflection of the polarized systems of microtubules in its interior • Along oriented tracks of microtubules, the cell is able to transport organelles, membrane vesicles, and macro-molecules Nerve cell axon 24 BR17520 Microtubules organize the cell interior Microtubule activity and function depends on a variety of accessory proteins that bind to them: microtubule associated proteins. They can for instance:  Stabilize microtubules against disassembly  Link microtubules to other cell components  Act as motor proteins that actively transport organelles, vesicles, and other macromolecules along microtubules: kinesins move towards (+), dyneins toward (-) Both kinesins and dyneins move (or “walk”) along microtubules using their globular heads • Kinesins and dyneins are dimers • Each dimer has two globular heads which bind and hydrolyse ATP and interact with microtubules • A single tail which interacts with the cargo. The tail determines what cargo the protein transports • They use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to move in one direction along the filament Kinesin protein takes a walk on a microtubule Fig. 17-19 in 5th edition (similar to 17-18 in 4th edition) 25 BR17520 Microtubule associated proteins • In some cases, the tail of the kinesin binds directly to the cargo, while in other cases, different adaptor proteins allow the same type of kinesin to carry different cargos. • Transport toward the minus end is mediated by cytoplasmic dynein, which generally uses adaptor proteins to interact with its selected cargo. Fig. 17-20 in 5th edition (similar to 17-19 in 4th edition) 26 BR17520 Different motor proteins transport different cargos The cytoskeleton consists of three major components each with a different structure, composed of different proteins, and performing a different set of functions.

Similar sliding movement mediates the contraction of interacting actin and myosin-II filaments in both muscle and non-muscle cells. 37 BR17520 Muscle contraction depends on actin and myosin filaments • Sarcomers are contractile units containing myosin and actin filaments • The contraction of a muscle cell is caused by the simultaneous shortening of the cell’s sarcomers, which is caused by the actin filaments sliding past the myosin filaments (there is no change in length of either type of filament) 38 BR17520 Muscle contraction depends on actin and myosin filaments The head of a myosin-II molecule walks along an actin filament through an ATP-dependent cycle of conformational changes 39 BR17520 Muscle contraction depends on actin and myosin filaments The cytoskeleton consists of three major components each with a different structure, composed of different proteins, and performing a different set of functions. Ø 10 nm Ø 25 nm Ø 7 nm 40 BR17520 The Cytoskeleton: Three types  Consists of microtubules, actin filaments and intermediate filaments  Helps cells maintain shape and internal organization, and it also provides mechanical support that enables cells to carry out essential functions like division and movement.  Intermediate filaments have great tensile strength and represent the toughest and most durable of the cytoskeletal filaments  The activity and function of microtubules and actin filaments depend on a variety of accessory proteins that bind to them. In particular for actin filaments, actin binding proteins can regulate their location, organization and behaviour.  Motor proteins are required for moving cargo along tracks of microtubules and actin filaments. These motor proteins change shape (costs energy!) to power movement and transport. 41 BR15320 Summary: The cytoskeleton Chapter 17 from Alberts et al.
