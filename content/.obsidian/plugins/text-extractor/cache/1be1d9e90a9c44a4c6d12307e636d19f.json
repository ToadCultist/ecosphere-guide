Mid Devonian and Carboniferous • Between 394 and 299 Ma evolution of small vascular plants to trees! • Shift in climate from hot and humid to cold and arid. • Drop in CO2 levels by 90%: 3600 to 300 ppm. • Increase in global O2 levels. Evolution of Trees • During the mid Devonian to the end of the Carboniferous plants had adapted to growing very tall through the evolution of:  The stele.  Supporting mechanisms: trunk with bark, extensive underground roots and root mantles.  Leaves. By Grand'Eury, François Cyrille - Grand'Eury, François Cyrille \"Mémoire sur la flore carbonifère du département de la Loire et du centre de la France: étudiée aux trois points de vue, botanique, stratigraphique et géognostique\" 1877, Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=33471300 Evolution of Life Cycle • There was significant evolutionary change in the life cycle of plants including:  The transition to heterospory.  The development of one functional megasporangium.  The seed coat.  Pre-pollen and true pollen. The First Tree…! • Gilboa tree (Pseudosprochnus) existed 385 Ma in mid Devonian. • Had leafless photosynthetic branches which were shed. • Found in water logged low oxygen soils. • Went extinct in late Devonian. Early Carboniferous • By the early Carboniferous there were four major plant lineages:  Sphenopsids – horsetails.  Lycopsides – club mosses.  Filicopsids – ferns.  Progymnosperms.  Cordaites – seed ferns  Pteridosperms – seed plants Spore producing lineages Seed producing lineages • Gymnosperms evolved in the early Carboniferous. 290 to 139 Ma • Throughout the Carboniferous, Permian, Triassic and Jurassic there was a period rapid evolution and increased geographic distribution of the gymnosperms. Evolution of Angiosperms • Angiosperms first appear in the fossil record approx. 138 Ma (lower Cretaceous). • Those early angiosperms had small inconspicuous flowers. • Often lacked petals. • Both male and female flowers. • Herbaceous or aquatic?? Diversity in obscurity: fossil flowers and the early history of angiosperms Else Marie Friis, Kaj Raunsgaard Pedersen, Peter R. Crane Importance of Insects • Those early angiosperms were probably pollinated by insects. • Insect pollination provided significant evolutionary advantages: enabled dispersal over long distances. • Wasps, bees and moths contributed to the radiation of flowering plants . • Early Earth… • Prokaryote Evolution • Eukaryote Evolution • Evolution of Algae • Chlorophytes • Terrestrial Invasion (and its impacts)! • Evolution of Trees • Early Carboniferous • Evolution of Angiosperms.
