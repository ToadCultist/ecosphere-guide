The structures stained brown in these cells are mitochondria * Mitochondria often fuse to form elongated tubular networks, which can extend throughout the cytoplasm. (A) cultured mouse fibroblast (B) yeast cell White fat tissue consists of cells filled with lipid droplets and very few mitochondria * What is the consequence of this and how can this be useful? Sperm mitochondria do not survive fertilisation In sperm cell, mitochondria are wrapped tightly around the motile flagellum ** BR17520 27 It is the mother who contributes mitochondria to the zygote, by way of the egg's cytoplasm. Sperm do contain mitochondria, but they are not usually inherited by the zygote. Consequence: The mother contributes mitochondria to the zygote Image from the NHS. BR17520 28 Because mitochondria are inherited from a person's mother, they provide a way to trace matrilineal ancestry (line of descent through an unbroken chain of female ancestors). Image from http://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/0_0_0/endosymbiosis_07 Useful: The mother contributes mitochondria to the zygote A person's mtDNA is identical to that of his or her direct maternal ancestor many generations ago. This fact can be used to connect people across decades. For example, if a particular type of mtDNA was found primarily in Africa, then we could conclude that people from elsewhere in the world who had that type of mtDNA had a maternal ancestor from Africa. BR17520 29  Mitochondria are present in essentially all eukaryotic cells  They generate usable energy in the form of ATP from food to power the cells  They have a double membrane system; the outer and inner membrane have a different permeability  The Krebs cycle (citric acid cycle) takes place inside the matrix  Inner membrane contains the respiratory enzyme complexes and ATP synthases  The electron transport chain which generates ATP takes place along the inner membrane  They are thought to have evolved from cyanobacteria (endosymbiont theory)  The mitochondria, and hence its DNA, is usually only inherited though the mother Summary: Structure and function of Mitochondria BR17520 30 Chloroplasts and Photosynthesis Membranes in both organelles –the mitochondrial inner membrane and the chloroplast thylakoid membrane- contain the protein complexes involved in ATP production BR17520 31 Chloroplasts and Photosynthesis  Virtually all organic material in present-day cells is produced by photosynthesis  Plants, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria use electrons from water and the energy from sunlight to convert atmospheric CO2 into organic compounds  In the course of these reactions, water molecules are split, releasing vast quantities of O2 into the atmosphere  supporting oxidative phosphorylation  In plants, photosynthesis is carried out in a specialised intracellular organelle: the chloroplast  The chloroplast contains light-capturing pigments such as the green pigment chlorophyll  Photosynthesis only occurs during the daylight hours, producing ATP and NADPH  These activated carriers can then be used (at any time of the day) to convert CO2 into sugar inside the chloroplast: carbon fixation BR17520 Chloroplasts and Photosynthesis MitochondriaChloroplasts BR17520 33 The characteristic structure of Chloroplasts  Chloroplasts are larger than mitochondria, but are organized along structurally similar principles.  Chloroplasts have an extra compartment: the thylakoid  The thylakoid membrane contains the light capturing systems, electron transport- chain, and ATP synthase that produce ATP during photosynthesis BR17520 34 The function of Chloroplasts light energy + CO2 + H2O  sugars + O2 + heat energy Similar to oxidative phosphorylation on the mitochondrial inner membrane BR17520 35 The function of Chloroplasts BR15320 light energy + CO2 + H2O sugars + O2 + heat energy - Stage 1: Occurs in the thylakoid membrane and is largely equivalent to the oxidative phosphorylation that takes place on the mitochondrial inner membrane. A series of photosynthetic electron transfer reactions produce ATP and NADPH; in the process electrons are extracted from water and oxygen is released as a by- product. - Stage 2: Carbon fixation reactions. They begin in the chloroplast stroma and continue in the cytosol. Carbon dioxide is assimilated (fixed) to produce sugars and a variety of other organic molecules Photosynthesis 36 Chloroplasts, chlorophyll and photosystems  Chlorophyll molecules absorb the energy from sunlight (light brings certain electrons in high-energy state)  Chlorophyll molecules are held in large multiprotein complexes called photosystems  Each photosystem consists of a set of antenna complexes, which capture light energy, and a reaction centre, which converts that light energy into chemical energy BR17520 37 Chloroplasts, chlorophyll and photosystems  Chlorophyll molecules absorb the energy from sunlight (light brings certain electrons in high-energy state)  Chlorophyll molecules are held in large multiprotein complexes called photosystems  Each photosystem consists of a set of antenna complexes, which capture light energy, and a reaction centre, which converts that light energy into chemical energy  In a reaction centre, a high energy electron is transferred from the special pair to a carrier that becomes part of an electron-transport chain BR17520 38 Chloroplasts, chlorophyll and photosystems  To build organic molecules from CO2 requires a huge input of energy (in the form of ATP) and a very large amount of reducing power (in the from of the activated carrier NADPH)  To generate both ATP and NADPH, plants use a pair of photosystems that are similar in structure, but do different things with the high-energy electrons that leave their reaction centre chlorophylls BR17520 39 Chloroplasts, chlorophyll and photosystem II  Photosystem II reaction centre passes electron to a mobile electron carrier called plastoquinone, which is part of the photosynthetic electron-transport chain  Plastoquinone transfers the high-energy electrons to a proton pump  generating an electrochemical proton gradient,  This gradient drives the production of ATP by ATP synthase in the thylakoid membrane BR17520 40 Chloroplasts, chlorophyll and photosystem I  At the same time, a second nearby photosystem (photosystem I) has also been busy capturing energy from sunlight  The reaction centre of this photosystem passes its high-energy electrons to a different mobile electron carrier (ferredoxin), which brings them to an enzyme (ferredoxin-NADP reductase) that uses them to reduce NADP+ to NADPH BR17520 41 Chloroplasts, chlorophyll and photosystem II and I  We have ignored one conundrum: when a mobile electron carrier removes an electron from a reaction centre, it leaves behind a positively charged chlorophyll special pair.  To reset the system and allow photosynthesis to proceed, this missing electron must be replaced.  Photosystem II: The reaction centre includes a water-splitting enzyme that extracts electrons from water. BR17520 42 Chloroplasts, chlorophyll and photosystem II and I  Essentially all of the oxygen in the Earth’s atmosphere has been produced by the water- splitting enzyme of photosystem II  Photosystem I gets the electrons it needs to reset its special pair from photosystem II  The chlorophyll special pair in photosystem I serves as the final electron acceptor for the electron-transport chain that carries electrons from photosystem II BR17520 43 Chloroplasts: photosystem I and II The combined action of photosystems I and II boost electrons to the energy level needed to produce both ATP and NADPH Carbon fixation (Calvin cycle) uses ATP and NADPH to convert CO2 into sugars BR17520 44 Chloroplasts evolved from engulfed bacteria (endosymbiont theory)  Like mitochondria, chloroplasts also have their own DNA and ribosomes and divide by fission. BR17520 45 Chloroplasts evolved from engulfed bacteria (endosymbiont theory)  Like mitochondria, chloroplasts also have their own DNA and ribosomes and divide by fission. BR17520 46 Summary: Structure and function of Chloroplasts  Chloroplasts are present in plants, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria such as cyanobacteria  During daylight, they use a process called photosynthesis to generate usable energy in the form of ATP and NADPH from sunlight  This ATP and NADPH is used inside the chloroplast to convert CO2 into sugars, a process called carbon fixation  Chloroplasts have three membranes; the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis take place on the thylakoid membranes.  Like mitochondria, chloroplasts are thought to have evolved from cyanobacteria (endosymbiont theory) BR17520 BR17520 Cell Biology Maurice Bosch mub@aber.ac.uk Mitochondria and Chloroplasts","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":""}
