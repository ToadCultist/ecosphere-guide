ARHOLIADAU EXAMINATIONS SEMESTER TWO EXAMINATIONS, 2019 INSTITUTE OF BIOLOGICAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND RURAL SCIENCES BR13610 THE GREEN PLANET Time allowed: ONE AND A HALF HOURS. Answer ALL questions. Answer all multiple choice questions on one optically marked sheet. You must answer each question in the order in which it appears on the question paper. Complete the boxes on the optically marked sheet to give the following details - name, date, subject, module identifier and student number. Student number should be completed by writing the digits in pencil in the top line of the box and then filling in the bar code boxes below with the first digit represented in column 1, the second digit in column 2 and so on. This is done by striking through the little box with a soft pencil as shown in the instructions on the sheet for marking the correct answers. Other instructions are on the sheet, but note the following:- There are five possible answers to each question, only one of them is correct. Record your answers on the optically read sheet by using a soft pencil (HB or softer) to mark the appropriate box thus: Do not tick, cross or ring boxes and do not write elsewhere on the form. ONE mark is given for every correct answer. No marks added/deducted for incorrect answers. No marks added/deducted for blank answers. If you make a mistake on the optically marked sheet, it can be corrected with a soft eraser. Spare sheets are available in the examination hall. Page 2 of 13 Continued_Overleaf... 1.
