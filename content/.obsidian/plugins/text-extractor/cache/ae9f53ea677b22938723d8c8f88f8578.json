Soil • Limit on prokaryote genome size – 10 million base pairs • Eukaryotes typically have much larger genomes Gene loss and gain • Excess genes – Slow replication • Eliminated rapidly by natural selection • Prokaryotes – Tend to lose genes not required immediately • Even if they might be useful later – Can acquire new genes • If environment changes • From living cells – Through conjugation • From dead cells – Through DNA uptake from environment Prokaryote genetics • Prokaryotes • Core genes • Inherited vertically • Passed from parents to offspring • Form phylogenetic tree • Other genes • Transferred laterally • Exchanged with unrelated individuals • Form network Metabolic diversity • “If a bacterium can find an electron, it will steal it” Anonymous • Hydrogenobaculum • Oxidises hydrogen • Gallionella • Oxidises Iron Extremophiles • Prokaryotes can survive – In deep sea hydrothermal vents • Black smokers – Extreme pressures and temperatures – Buried several miles deep within Earth’s crust – In highly radioactive environments • Outer space • Nuclear power stations • Radioactively sterilised cans of meat – In the dry valleys of Antarctica – In Siberian permafrost – In highly acid and alkaline environments • Volcanic springs Strain 121 • Archaean • Iron-reducing metabolism • Discovered in hydrothermal vent • Able to metabolise at 121°C • Goes dormant at 130°C • Revives if placed in boiling water at 100°C Sulfolobus • Acidophile thermophilic archaean • Inhabits Sulphur Cauldron, Yellowstone – Boiling, sulphurous spring • Oxidises hydrogen sulphide and sulphur – Produces sulphuric acid • Derives energy • Acidifies water to pH 2 • Little competition – Sulfolobus is extremely abundant locally Prokaryote cooperation • Prokaryotes – Limited in size • By cell structure • By respiration across external membrane – Unable to engulf other cells – Unable to store resources within cells • Must out-replicate competitors – Selection to reduce competition • By diversifying metabolism – Recycle others’ waste products » Form interdependent communities Prokaryote communities • Different prokaryote species – Exist in mutually beneficial associations • One species uses waste products of another – Form mats and biofilms Precambrian fossils • Pecambrian rocks – Rare • Mostly consumed by plate tectonics • Stromatolites – Form fossils • Ubiquitous in rocks from shallow seas • Extend back into Archaean era – Oldest are 3.5 billion years old – Formed diverse shapes • Fingers, fists, cauliflowers, columns, spindles, trees, mushrooms, kidneys – Complexity increases with time » Greatest in proterozoic era Photosynthesis • Great oxygenation event – Initiated by cyanobacteria – Oxygenated the atmosphere • Caused iron to rust • Until 2.4 billion years ago – Oxygen absorbed by oxidation of minerals • Between 1.8 and 0.8 billion years ago – Oxygenation stalled (“Boring billion”) • Possibly due to competition from purple sulphur bacteria – Photosynthesised without oxygen » using abundant sulphur » Less energetically expensive Stromatolites • Prokaryotic cells – Build up layer by layer • Form mound • Top layer – Cyanobacteria (blue-green “algae”) • Photosynthetic prokaryotes • Form biofilm – Mat of overlapping filaments • Slimy surface – Causes precipitation of calcium carbonate » Forms crust • Incremental growth – Forms mound Stromatolites • Declined – following evolution of animals • Grazing animals – Molluscs etc. – Prevent mound formation – Absent from ancient Earth • Present day stromatolites – Restricted to protected habitats • Low nutrients • Few grazers – Due to hypersaline consitions » e.g. Shark Bay, Australia; Antarctic lakes • Small colony – Recently discovered in Ireland (giant’s causeway) Stromatolite communities • On surface – Different cyanobacterial species coexist • Beneath surface – Other prokaryotes process waste products – Include anaerobic species – Include nitrogen-fixers Anaerobes • Dominated early Earth • Respire without oxygen – Unable to metabolise in presence of oxygen • Great oxygenation event – Excluded anaerobes from much of the Earth • Survive in anaerobic pockets – Thrive under appropriate conditions » Anoxic mud » Animal guts Methanogens • Archaea • React hydrogen with carbon dioxide – Forms methane gas • Produces energy and organic compounds – Hydrogen • Reacts with oxygen to from water – Unavailable in oxygenated environments • Out-competed for hydrogen – By sulphate-reducing bacteria • Produce hydrogen sulphide • Only survive where oxygen and sulphate are absent – Bottom of freshwater lakes – Stagnant marshes • Produce marsh gas – Guts of herbivores and vegetarians Dispersal of prokaryotes • Prokaryotes – Extremely small • Very widely dispersed • Cosmopolitan hypothesis – No geographical boundaries to prokaryote dispersal • ‘everything is everywhere’ • ‘the environment selects’ – (de Wit & Bouvier, 2006) Do prokaryotes form species? • Distantly related prokaryotes – Exchange DNA • Through horizontal transfer • If core genes – are always transmitted vertically • From mother to daughter cells – or are only exchanged with closely related individuals • True prokaryote species may exist • If all genes are transferred horizontally – To distantly related individuals • Species concept is difficult to apply Do prokaryotes ever go extinct? • If free-living prokaryotes do not form true species – The concept of extinction • can apply only to clones and genes • Even if prokaryotes do form species – They are small • Can occupy tiny microhabitats – They are widely dispersed • Can locate tiny microhabitats – They form highly resistant spores • Can wait for conditions to improve – They are extremely adaptable • Can evolve rapidly to withstand environmental change","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":""}
