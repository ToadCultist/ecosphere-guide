Restoring inbred populations • Translocate individuals from a genetically healthy population • A small number of individuals can make a huge difference • Florida panther • Scandinavian wolf • Greater prairie chicken Outbreeding depression • Parents from different populations – Produce offspring of reduced fitness • Breakdown of local adaptation – Intermediates less fit • Breakdown of co-adapted gene complexes – Alleles common in one population are incompatible with alleles common in the other • Effects may not be seen until F2 generation – Masked in F1 by heterozygosity Example: Alpine Ibex • Alpine Ibex – Locally extinct in Tatra mountains • Reintroduced from Italian Alps – A bottlenecked population • Nubian ibex and Bezoar – Mediterranean subspecies – Also introduced to increase genetic diversity • Adapted to warmer climate – Breed earlier • Interbreeding – Led to entire population breeding early • Young produced in February – all died – Population went extinct Example: Atlantic salmon • Farmed salmon • Escapees interbreed with wild salmon • Reduced fitness in offspring Loss of genetic diversity • Genetic diversity – Measured as • Proportion of polymorphic loci • Number of alleles at a locus • Proportion of heterozygotes – Raw material for adaptation • To environmental change • To disease – Decreases with reduced population size • Due to genetic drift Accumulation of deleterious mutations • Genetic drift • Increases in small populations • Becomes stronger relative to purifying selection • May cause increase in prevalence of deleterious alleles Example: Koalas on Kangaroo Island • Koalas – Endangered on Australian mainland – Population translocated to French Island – Further translocation from French Island to Kangaroo Island • Double founder effect – High numbers – Low genetic diversity – High incidence of testicular abnormalities • Little evidence of inbreeding – Probably due to genetic drift Adaptation to captivity • Natural and artificial selection – Adapts organism to captive environment • Reduces fitness in natural environment – Reduces likelihood of successful reintroduction • Directed artificial selection – Intentional selection for traits desirable for handling, breeding and exhibiting organisms • Unconscious artificial selection – Unintentional selection for desirable traits • Incidental artificial selection – Caused by properties of the captive environment • E.g. abundant water, lack of predators, lack of parasites Question • How would you prevent adaptation to captivity? Preventing adaptation to captivity • Minimise number of generations in captivity – Rapid reintroduction where possible – Delayed reproduction – Cryopreservation • Of sperm and oocytes • Minimise selection – Use systematic breeding strategy • All individuals make equal reproductive contribution – Often impractical due to need for culling – Mimic natural environment • Fragment populations – Selection is less effective in small populations • Reduce risk of inbreeding by translocating some individuals between populations • Immigration – Continue to bring wild individuals into the population","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
