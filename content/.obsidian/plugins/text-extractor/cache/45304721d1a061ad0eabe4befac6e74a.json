Reproduction – individuals must be able to form a new generation 2. Inheritance – offspring should mostly look like their parents 3. Variation – individuals are not all identical 4. Variation in fitness – some characteristics increase reproducibility meaning more offspring Variation in populations Morphological - Physical features - Polymorphic: more than one recognisable form in a population Cellular - Number and structure of chromosomes - Presence/absen ce if genes and proteins Biochemical - Sequence of amino acids within a protein DNA - Sequence of nucleotides within a gene (RFLP) Mutation and recombination generate variation, but it’s random Natural selection explains evolution and adaptation Pink salmon in Pacific Northwest have been decreasing in size. Differences in size ranged from 0.3-0.48Ib (0.14-0.22kg) : 1/3 size. Why? Since 1945 fishermen have increased the size of gill netting. This selection is having “unexpected” effects.. Linked to small size has been selection for slow growth..Why? Remember the drive for increased fecundity, slow breeding Increases period of breeding. (Note, smaller fish produce few eggs than larger) (Conover & Munch, 2000) Small removed large removed 9 Human Birth weight In London, UK (1935-46) babies heavier or lighter than average did not survive as well. 1011 African finch Black bellied seed-cracker Several species of sedge in finches environment producing seeds of varying strength. (Bimodal resource allocation – hard and soft seeds) Smaller billed specialise on soft Seeds, harder on harder. Are we observing a speciation event? or adaptation? 11","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
