Paleoclimates How are paleoclimates studied?How far back can we go? Centuries to millennia - natural climate variation in temperature and precipitation Tens of thousands to millions of years – climate change, geologic processes, abrupt changes Deep time (millions of years) – extreme climate states and long-term climate patterns National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Paleoclimatology Program/Department of Commerce Paleoclimate archives – tree-ringsPaleoclimate archives - sediments Varve – an annual layer of sediment Paleoclimate archives – ice cores Snow accumulation → glaciers https://icecores.org/about-ice-cores Paleoclimate archives – speleothemsPaleoclimate archives – coralsPaleoclimate proxies - physicalPaleoclimate proxies - biological Fern spikes Paleoclimate proxies - chemicalO18 Antarctica Equator Paleoclimate proxies - chemical During ice ages, cooler temperatures extend toward the equator, Heavy oxygen condenses out of the atmosphere at even lower latitudes than it does under milder conditions. This gives the O18 longer to condense so that when the air reaches current polar regions it is more deleted in O18. Thus ice-cores in current polar regions can indicate the extent of the ice sheet in former times. Relative O18 loss Slower O16 condensation NOW Relative O18 loss Slower O16 condensation ICE AGE CORES from here will have lower O18 Paleoclimate proxies - chemical Warmer Colder More O18 More O16 Paleoclimate proxies - chemical reduces the salinity of the oceans worldwide More O18 More O16 Less saline More saline","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
