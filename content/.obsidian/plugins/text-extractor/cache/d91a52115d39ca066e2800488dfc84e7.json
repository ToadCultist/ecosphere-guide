Medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency (MCAD) Phenylketonuria • Unable to metabolise the amino acid phenyalanine. • Accumulation of Phe causes microcephaly and brain dysfunction • Diagnosed at birth via heel prick test • Treatment requires avoiding foods containing phenylalanine Medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency (MCAD) • Affects beta-oxidation. • Stops medium length FAs being decomposed into AcCoA • Causes hypoglycaemia and leads to sudden death (typically in infants) O S-CoA C R FAD + 2H + FADH2 Trans-Enoyl-CoA H2O Hydroxy-Acyl-CoA NAD + 2H NADH + H Keto-Acyl-CoA SH-CoA Acetyl CoA14C Fatty Acid 16C Fatty Acid Glycogen Storage Disease • 15 discrete types • Affects 1 in 13,000 people • Defects in enzymes of glycogen synthesis and/or breakdown. • Tend to lead to muscle cramping, weakness and myopathy. • Glycogen branching enzyme deficiency causes death at ~5 years of age. Type I diabetes • Onset around puberty • Affects ~80,000 people per year • Destruction of beta cells in the pancreas • No production of insulin • “Starvation in the face of plenty” • Failure to store sugars after meals • Treated with regular insulin injections Type II Diabetes • Onset later in life • >90% of all diabetes cases • Affects nearly 450 million people • Costs global economy $727 billion USD annually • Promoted by high sugar diet, lack of exercise • Resistance to own insulin • Treated with insulin injections, sulfonylureas Acidosis • Diabetic ketoacidosis • Breakdown of FA accumulates AcCoA • Excess AcCoA is converted into ketone bodies • Very high levels of ketone bodies lower blood pH • The resulting acidosis is fatal without prompt treatment • Dietary acidosis • Breakdown of amino acids leads to ketone body formation • High-Protein diets can induce ketosis and ketonuria, promoting gout and kidney stones. Alcohol detoxification • The most dangerous drug (ISCD survey 2010). • Ethanol metabolism happens in the liver. • It produces acetaldehyde and then acetate (AcCoA) with NADH • High NADH causes production of fat, ketones and lactate • Fat deposits in liver, acid scarring (cirrhosis), liver damage. Vitamin deficiencies • 8 of 13 essential vitamins are co-factors for metabolic enzymes • Deficiencies often result in anaemia and skin conditions. • E.g. Vitamin B12 required for AA and FA metabolism • The link reaction enzyme PDH requires vitamins B1, B5, and B6. Poisons • Inhibitors of enzymes of metabolism • Often affect mitochondrial enzymes Rotenone, cyanide, etc • Rotenone inhibits Complex I • Antimycin A inhibits Complex III • Cyanide and CO inhibit Complex IV • Oligomycin inhibits ATP synthase Uncouplers • UCP is an ‘uncoupling’ protein • It allows protons to freely cross the inner mitochondrial membrane • The energy released by proton influx is not captured as ATP • It uncouples ETC activity from ATP synthesis. • Instead it produces heat • Used by the brown fat in newborns to maintain body temperature 2, 4, Di-nitro phenol • Explosive, pesticide and wood preservative • Hydrophilic/phobic, can bind protons • Uncouples ETC activity and ATP synthase. • Lumberjack poisoning • Rapid weight loss with fever, leading to death • ATP levels low, so fat wastefully oxidised to generate a proton gradient • Dubious use as weight-loss drug Key messages • Metabolism can be disturbed by poisons, genetic disorders, autoimmune diseases and diet. • Genetic disorders of metabolism are usually recessive. • Many poisons inhibit the enzymes of metabolism. • Diabetes is a particularly common metabolic dysfunction. • Diet also has an important effect on metabolic function","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":""}
