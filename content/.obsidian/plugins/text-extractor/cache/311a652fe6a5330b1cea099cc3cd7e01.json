Human Gene Therapy and Gene Editing Gene therapy—the introduction of genes and Gene Editing Gene therapy—the introduction of genes into an afflicted individual for the disorder. For gene therapy of somatic cells to be permanent, the cells that one procedure for gene therapy in an individual whose bone marrow cells do not was used in gene therapy trials for SCID in France in 2000, resulting in indisputable success of gene therapy. However, three patients subsequently developed leukemia, a type of somewhat successfully with gene therapy, including a type of progressive blindness (see Concept .
