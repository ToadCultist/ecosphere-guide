{"path":"University/Lecture slides/Module archive/Microbial and plant diversity/Plants & Light.pdf","text":"BR19920 Plants & Light Dr Dylan Phillips (dwp@aber.ac.uk) Objectives By end of lecture, you should understand: • ‘Photoperiodism’ & its discovery in plants • ‘Short’ and ‘long’ day flowering plants • Economic & ecological importance • ‘Phytochrome’ & other photoreceptors Tobacco farming • Crop ‘topped’ by flower removal → bigger leaves • Leaves ‘cured’ in barn with smoke (or ethylene) Discovery of ‘photoperiodism’ • 1906: tobacco mutant → ‘Maryland Mammoth’ variety • Failed to flower in summer like typical tobacco varieties • Good for leaf production, but seed needed for propagation • How to induce flowers? ‘Maryland Mammoth’: no flowers Typical cultivar: flowers in summer Discovery of ‘photoperiodism’ • Garner & Allard, USDA, Virginia  question from crop growers: • Why did soybeans flower at same time, despite staggered planting to try & prolong harvest? Discovery of ‘photoperiodism’ • Garner & Allard, USDA, Virginia: summer 1918 • Test plants → 7 h outdoors then into dark shed daily • ‘Short’ days • Control plants 14 h outdoors • ‘Long’ days Discovery of ‘photoperiodism’ Garner & Allard, USDA, Virginia: summer 1918  • Test plants → 7 h outdoors then into dark shed daily • ‘Short’ days • Control plants 14 h outdoors • ‘Long’ days ‘Maryland Mammoth’ tobacco Discovery of ‘photoperiodism’ • Garner & Allard, USDA, Virginia: summer 1918 • Test plants → 7 h outdoors then into dark shed daily • ‘Short’ days • Control plants outdoors → natural 14 h day-length • ‘Long’ days ‘Biloxi’ soybeans  Discovery of ‘photoperiodism’ • Garner & Allard, USDA, Virginia: summer 1919 • Scaled-up experiments & tested more species • Garner & Allard Virginia: summer 1919 • Tested wildflowers Tested: ‘stiff-leaved aster’ (Asteraceae) • Test plants → 7 h outdoors then dark • Only test plants flowered  ‘short-day’ flowering plant • Controls → outdoors Tested: ‘common ragweed’ (Asteraceae) • Test plants → 7 h outdoors then dark • Only test plants flowered  ‘short-day’ flowering plant • Controls → outdoors Tested: ‘climbing hempweed’ (Asteraceae) • Test plants → 7 h outdoors then dark • Only controls flowered  ‘long-day’ flowering plant • Controls → outdoors Tested: ‘rose mallow’ (Malvaceae) • Test plants → 7 h outdoors then dark • Only controls flowered  ‘long-day’ flowering plant • Controls → outdoors • Garner & Allard Virginia: winter 1919 • Artificial lights to extend winter days Tested: ‘beggar-ticks’ (Asteraceae) • Test plants → artificial lights: 16 h light period • Controls → winter days • Only controls flowered  ‘short-day’ flowering plant Tested: ‘Iris florentina’ (Iridaceae) • Test plants → artificial lights: 16 h light period • Controls → winter days • Only test plants flowered  ‘long-day’ flowering plant Discovery of ‘photoperiodism’ • Garner & Allard (1920)  new concepts • ‘Photoperiodism’ • ‘Response of organisms to the relative length of day and night’ • ‘Short-day’ plants • Many indigenous to low latitudes (→ avoid summer droughts) • In temperate regions, flower when days shorter • ‘Long-day’ plants • Native to temperate regions • Flower in longer midsummer days Photoperiodism and crop origins • Fertile Crescent → long-day crops • Tropics → short- day crops • Historical spread of crops to different latitudes • Often selection for modified photoperiodic responses has occurred  genes involved Photoperiodism and crop origins • William Morse, USDA, Virginia  classed varieties into ‘maturity groups’ in 1918 • Varieties now matched to geographic photoperiod  genes involved Photoperiodism and soybeansPhotoperiodism and phenology • Spring → advanced 2.5 d decade-1 since 1971 • Temperate tree buds controlled by winter chilling, ambient temperate - and photoperiod • Species responses differ • Hard to predict warming effects on phenology • Photoperiod will not change!

Science 327: 1461-1462 Beech Hornbeam Lilac Flowering control in floriculture • Many popular ornamental crops flower by daylength can be artificially controlled Poinsettia - short-day plant indigenous to Mexico Black cloth → induce flowers in short-day plants Chrysanthemum - short-day plant indigenous to China Day extension lights → delay flowers in short-day plants Marigold - short-day plant indigenous to S America Day extension lights → induce flowers in long-day plants Antirrhinum - long-day plant indigenous to Mediterranean ‘National Historic Chemical Landmark’: isolation of phytochrome • Ceremony at USDA Research Center, Beltsville, Maryland, 21 Oct 2015 • 40-year research effort Borthwick (right) tested light period hypothesis Discovery of ‘phytochrome’ • 1936: USDA project on photoperiodism • Beltsville Agricultural Research Center in Maryland • Brief ‘night break’ light  long day In fact, dark is the critical period Antirrhinum - long-day plant indigenous to Mediterranean Night break lights → induce flowers in long-day plants Discovery of ‘phytochrome’ • Night break → prism cast different colours on array of plants • Found that red light strongest inhibitor of flowering H.A.

Hendricks (1902-1981) Short-day plant Long-day plantHoursRed v far-red reversibility • Flash of red (660 nm) cancelled by far-red (730 nm) flash • Last flash determines response Discovery of ‘phytochrome’ • 1959: USDA project built sensitive spectrophotometer • Maize shoots (3 d old, dark-grown) FAR-RED irradiated RED irradiated Discovery of ‘phytochrome’ • 1959: USDA project built sensitive spectrophotometer • Maize shoots (3 d old, dark- grown) • Detected change in absorption spectra after irradiation with red (660 nm) or far-red (730 nm) light Interconvertible ‘Pr’ &‘Pfr’ forms Red light Far-red light Pr Pfr • In cyanobacterium phytochrome: • Pr: absorbs at 660 nm • Pfr: absorbs at 730 nm Light changes chromophore & protein conformation Red light Far-red light Pfr translocates to nucleus • Pfr = biologically active form  red light → biological effect R:FR ratio  environmental signal • Leaf canopy absorbs red but not far- red light → lowers R:FR ratio • Shoots respond with ‘shade avoidance’ growth Daylight spectra Plants also have blue light photoreceptors Summary • ‘Photoperiod’ controls flowering in many species (dark period critical) • Subject to genetic variation between and within species • Major economic and ecological importance • Phytochrome responsible for red/far-red reversible responses • Shade avoidance growth responds to R:FR Image acknowledgments Wikimedia Commons, https://commons.wikimedia.org American Chemical Society, https://www.acs.org Butler et al.
