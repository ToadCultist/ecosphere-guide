Water • Tetrahedron • 2 bonds • 2 unshared pairs Hydrogen bonds • Non-covalent bond between d+ and d-. • Weak • Transient • Numerous • On average each water molecule in liquid water is hydrogen bonded to 3.4 other water molecules H-bonding in DNA This Photo by Unknown Author is licensed under CC BY-NC H-bonding in proteins This Photo by Unknown Author is licensed under CC BY NaCl solid -> solution https://iteachly.com/mole-conversion-worksheet-activity/ For an athlete with 5 g/L NaCl in their sweat, what is the molarity of NaCl? Moles = mass / molar mass Moles = 5 / (23+35.5) Moles = 5 / 58.5 = 0.085 moles Concentration = No Moles / Volume Concentration = 0.085 / 1 = 0.085 mol.l-1 or 85 mM The practicalities of media preparation This Photo by Unknown Author is licensed under CC BY-SA-NC Task dependent This Photo by Unknown Author is licensed under CC BY This Photo by Unknown Author is licensed under CC BY-SA-NC This Photo by Unknown Author is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND Figure 22.1 How to read a volumetric scale (aqueous solution).

What type of molecule is sucrose? 1. Prepare 800 mL of distilled water in a suitable container. 2. Add 8 g of Sodium chloride to the solution. 3. Add 0.4 g of Potassium Chloride to the solution. 4. Add 0.14 g of Calcium Chloride to the solution. 5. Add 0.1 g of Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate to the solution. 6. Add 0.1 g of Magnesium Chloride Hexahydrate to the solution. 7. Add 0.06 g of Sodium Phosphate Dibasic Dihydrate to the solution. 8. Add 0.06 g of Potassium Phosphate Monobasic to the solution. 9. Add 1 g of D-Glucose (Dextrose) to the solution. 10. Add 0.35 g of Sodium bicarbonate to the solution. 11. Add distilled water until the volume is 1 L. HBSS (Hank's Balanced Salt Solution) Preparation and Recipe Maintains physiological pH and osmotic balance for cells. Rhowch grynodiad y potasiwm clorid fel %w/v yn y cyfrwng terfynol. Cyfrifwch grynodiad y potasiwm clorid mewn molau fesul litr yn y cyfrwng terfynol. Masau atomig cymharol: potasiwm = 39, clorin = 35.5. Dangoswch sut y cyrhaeddwch eich ateb. Give the concentration of the potassium chloride as %w/v in the final medium. Calculate the concentration of potassium chloride in moles per litre in the final medium. Relative atomic masses: potassium = 39, chlorine = 35.5.
