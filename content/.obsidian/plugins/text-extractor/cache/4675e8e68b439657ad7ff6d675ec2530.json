They conﬁrm that ants are sister to bees and apoid wasps and that bees are specialized crabronid wasps. They also demonstrate that taxon sampling can have a strong impact on phylogenetic results even when using genome-scale data. Branstetter et al., 2017, Current Biology 27, 1019–1025 April 3, 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2017.03.027 Among the taxa from which we sequenced enriched UCE loci, we captured an average of 966 UCE contigs per sample, with a mean contig length of 801 bp and an average coverage per UCE contig of 803 (see Data S1 for assembly information). We evalu- ated the effects of ﬁltering alignments for various levels of taxon occupancy (percentage of taxa required to be present in a given locus) and selected the 75% ﬁltered locus set (‘‘Hym-187T-F75’’) as the primary locus set for analysis. This dataset included 854 loci and 203,095 bp of sequence data, of which 143,608 sites were informative (see Data S1 for alignment matrix information). We analyzed the Hym-187T-F75 dataset using maximum-like- lihood (ML; RAxML v8 [16]), Bayesian (BI; ExaBayes v1.4 [17]), and species-tree (ST; ASTRAL-II [18]) approaches. For ML ana- lyses, we compared several different data-partitioning schemes (see Data S1 for more information) and two approaches de- signed to mitigate phylogenetic error caused by base composi- tion heterogeneity and/or substitution saturation. For the latter approaches, we created one dataset in which we converted the entire matrix to RY coding and one in which we removed loci exhibiting signs of base composition heterogeneity among taxa (47 loci removed). For ST analysis, we employed weighted statistical binning to reduce error from loci with low information content [19]. We recovered a robust phylogeny of the Aculeata, with topol- ogies being nearly identical across all analyses (Figures 1, S1, and S2). We observed topological conﬂict at eight nodes, with the most important difference concerning relationships among families of the Chrysidoidea (cuckoo wasps and relatives). We recovered the Trigonaloidea as sister to stinging wasps (Acu- leata) with maximum support in all analyses. Although we lacked several parasitoid superfamilies in our dataset, this result is congruent with most recent molecular analyses [8, 10, 15]. Importantly, we did not recover the Ichneumonoidea, a long- standing candidate as the sister group to Aculeata [13], to be closely related to the stinging wasps in any analysis. Within Acu- leata, we found Chrysidoidea to form a paraphyletic grade, with the clade containing Sclerogibbidae+[Embolemidae+Dryinidae] recovered as the sister group to remaining non-chrysidoid line- ages in most analyses. The rest of the aculeate superfamilies divided into two major clades that were each highly supported in all analyses. Overall, relationships among superfamilies largely agree with a recent transcriptome-based study [6], except for the placement of Vespoidea. Ants (Formicidae) were inferred to be the sister group to bees and apoid wasps with maximum support in all analyses, except for the RY-coded ML analysis (96%) and the ST analysis (90%). Within the clade containing bees and apoid wasps (Apoidea), our results for relationships among families and higher-level clades are identical across analyses and largely agree with those of Debevec et al. [5]. Most signiﬁcantly, we found the bees (An- thophila) to be nested inside of a paraphyletic Crabronidae and sister to Pemphredoninae+Philanthinae, conﬁrming the ﬁnding ﬁrst reported in [5], which was based on only four molecular markers and received only moderate support. Within Apoidea, we also found Ampulicidae to be the sister group to all other apoid families and Heterogynaidae, a phylogenetically enigmatic family, to be the sister group to Crabroninae+Sphecidae. Among bees (Anthophila), our results are largely congruent with previous studies of higher-level relationships [20]. Most notably, we found Melittidae to be the sister group to the remaining bee families, and we recovered monophyly of the eusocial corbiculate tribes (Apini, Bombini, and Meliponini) in all concatenated analyses (not recovered in the ST analysis). Testing the Phylogenetic Position of Ants and Bees Identifying the phylogenetic positions of ants and bees within the stinging wasps is of critical importance. Ants are ecologically dominant social insects in virtually all terrestrial ecosystems, and bees are among the most important pollinators of the largest lineage of vascular plants on earth—the angiosperms. To eval- uate the robustness of our phylogenetic results, we performed two types of analyses. First, we evaluated a range of previous phylogenetic hypotheses for both ants and bees using the Shi- modaira-Hasegawa (SH) test [21]. For the SH tests, we analyzed nine alternate positions for ants and 14 alternate positions for bees (Table 1), taking into account previous phylogenetic hy- potheses for both taxa (ants [4, 6, 8, 9]; bees [5, 22–25]). We per- formed the tests with the most taxon-rich 187-taxon dataset and with a taxonomically balanced 100-taxon dataset. In all cases, the alternative topologies were rejected (p < 0.01), providing un- equivocal support for the preferred topology presented here. Based on these analyses and our current level of taxon sampling, ants are the sister group to Apoidea, and bees are clearly highly derived crabronid wasps. Second, we analyzed the impact of taxon sampling on our phylogenetic results. Previous phylogenomic studies based on far fewer taxa than we included here have obtained conﬂicting results regarding the placement of ants vis-a` -vis Apoidea. The transcriptome-based study of Johnson et al. [6] found ants to be sister to Apoidea (the result here), whereas the UCE-based study of Faircloth et al. [7] found ants to be sister to all other acu- leates, with the exception of Chrysidoidea, which was not included in their analyses. We divided the taxon-sampling exper- iments into the following categories (Figure 2): (1) variations of Johnson et al. [6], (2) variations of Faircloth et al. [7], and (3) var- iations of the current taxon set. In the ﬁrst category, we gener- ated two datasets, one with exactly the same taxon sampling as [6] (‘‘Johnson-19T’’) and one with the chrysidoid Argochrysis armilla removed (‘‘Johnson-18T’’). We included this particular manipulation because the major difference between [6] and [7] was the presence or absence of Chrysidoidea, which is the sister taxon to all other aculeate groups. For the Faircloth et al. [7] ma- nipulations, we recreated the original 45-taxon matrix (‘‘Fair- cloth-45T’’) and several alternative taxon sets. First, we added a single chrysidoid (‘‘Faircloth-46T’’), and then we continued to add additional aculeates to balance taxa across major lineages (‘‘Faircloth-52T,’’ ‘‘Faircloth-56T,’’ and ‘‘Faircloth-61T’’). We also balanced the dataset by removing excessive ant taxa from the original dataset (‘‘Faircloth-26T’’) and then adding in a chrysidoid (‘‘Faircloth-27T’’). For the third category, we gener- ated a dataset with most outgroups removed (‘‘Hym-147T’’), leaving Nasonia as the earliest diverging outgroup and Megaspi- lus (Ceraphronoidea), Evanioidea, and Trigonaloidea as more recently diverging outgroups. From this taxon set, we removed chrysidoids (‘‘Hym-133T’’) and chrysidoids plus trigonaloids (‘‘Hym-131T’’). We also created what we considered to be the most balanced dataset by removing excessive ant, bee, and wasp taxa (‘‘Hym-100T’’). 1020 Current Biology 27, 1019–1025, April 3, 2017 050100150200250 Pamphiloidea [1] Tenthredinoidea [8] Ichneumonoidea [7] Evanioidea [3] Proctotrupoidea (Pelecinidae) [2] Cynipoidea [5] Cephoidea [2] Orussoidea [1] Xyeloidea [1] Ceraphronoidea [1] Chalcidoidea [10] Proctotrupoidea (Roproniidae) [1] Xyphidrioidea [1] Siricoidea [1] Diaprioidea [1] Mutillidae [9] Crabronidae (Bembicinae) [3] Colletidae (Callomelittinae) [1] Colletidae (Colletinae) [1] Melittidae (Meganomiinae) [1] Trigonaloidea [2] Sapygidae [2] Sphecidae [3]* Colletidae (Xeromelissinae) [1] Heterogynaidae [1] Megachilidae (Lithurginae) [1] Formicidae [14] Sierolomorphidae [1] Chrysididae [3] Pompilidae [4] Sphecidae [3] Dryinidae [1] Bradynobaenidae [2] Megachilidae (Pararhophitinae) [1] Colletidae (Euryglossinae) [1] Vespidae [9] Scoliidae [3] Megachilidae (Megachilinae) [6] Thynnidae [3] Stenotritidae [1] Crabronidae (Pemphredoninae) [2] Colletidae (Hylaeinae) [1] Colletidae (Scrapterinae) [1] Sclerogibbidae [1] Tiphiidae [3] Ampulicidae [1] Rhopalosomatidae [1] Embolemidae [1] Bethylidae [3] Apidae (Apinae) [14]* Crabronidae (Crabroninae) [5] Andrenidae (Panurginae) [1] Crabronidae (Crabroninae) [1] Melittidae (Melittinae) [2] Melittidae (Dasypodainae) [2] Halictidae (Rophitinae) [2] Crabronidae (Philanthinae) [3] Andrenidae (Oxaeinae) [1] Myrmosidae [1] Andrenidae (Andreninae) [3] Halictidae (Nomiinae) [1] Plumariidae [1] Chyphotidae [2] Halictidae (Halictinae) [6] Colletidae (Neopasiphaeinae) [1] Colletidae (Diphaglossinae) [1] Apidae (Xylocopinae) [4] Aculeata (Stinging Wasps) Anthophila (Bees) Apoidea Triassic Jurassic Cretaceous Paleog NeoPer */82/*/*/*/81 77/66/-/79/*/58 78/87/-/91/-/27 */97/*/*/*/* 87/70/66/82/-/97 91/80/95/*/*/49 90/83/-/59/*/- 86/75/99/60/*/76 */*/*/99/*/69 3 4 5 3 4 5“Sawflies”“Parasitic Wasps” < 90% Support (No Conflict) Topological Conflict Ants 1 2 1 2 Apocrita Millions of Years Ago (Ma) Chrysidoidea Vespoidea Sierolomorphoidea Tiphioidea Thynnoidea Pompiloidea Scolioidea Formicoidea Apoidea Figure 1.

Current Biology 27, 1019–1025, April 3, 2017 1021 The results of the taxon-sampling experiments (Table 2) support the conclusion that, even with genome-scale data, both outgroup choice and taxonomic balance impact phyloge- netic results. The Faircloth et al. [7] study suffered from both of these issues, and we suspect that the trees obtained in that study are incorrect with regard to the position of ants. Focusing on the placement of ants (Formicoidea: Formicidae), we recov- ered three alternative topologies (Figure 2; Table 2): ants sister to Apoidea (topology A); ants sister to all other groups, minus Chrysidoidea (topology B); and ants sister to Apoidea plus Sco- lioidea (topology C). In both of the Johnson et al. [6] matrices, we recovered topology A. Analysis of the original Faircloth et al. [7] taxon set (Faircloth-45T) produced topology B, as in the original study. For Faircloth-46T, Faircloth-52T, and Faircloth-56T, we also recovered topology B. However, in the Faircloth-61T ana- lyses, the topology shifted to C, placing ants as sister to Scolioi- dea plus Apoidea. The difference between Faircloth-56T and Faircloth-61T was the addition of several chrysidoids (Embole- midae and Dryinidae), Rhopalosomatidae (Vespoidea), and Ampulicidae (Apoidea), with the latter two taxa breaking long branches. Reducing and balancing the taxa of Faircloth-45T also altered the resulting topology. Reducing the number of ant taxa from 22 in Faircloth-45T to three taxa in Faircloth-26T changed the topology to A. The Hym-147T matrix and variants (Hym-133T, Hym-131T, and Hym-100T) also produced topology A. For the Hym-100T matrix, in which we reduced the number of ant and bee taxa to balance the larger taxon set, all relationships, in addition to the placement of ants, were the same as those in the ML analysis of the Hym-187T matrix. In addition to the topological differences just described, removing outgroups from matrices (chrysidoids or trigonaloids) usually resulted in decreased bootstrap scores for the position of ants (Table 2). Biological Implications Our results resolve long-standing debates in aculeate phylogeny and provide a solid framework for understanding both the impor- tance of pollenivory as a driver of bee diversiﬁcation and the importance of eusociality as a driver of ant diversiﬁcation and ecological dominance. Ants and bees are surprisingly closely related, which impacts how we view the evolution of important Table 1.

It is important to highlight the fact that eusociality has evolved once at the origin of ants and at least six to eight times within bees [20], which means that the clade containing ants and bees may be particularly pre-disposed to becoming social. As discussed in [6], understanding the biology of all of the lineages within the Apoidea (bees and apoid wasps) will provide new insights into the biological factors that promote the evolution of social behavior. Our results largely corroborate previous ﬁndings regarding re- lationships within Apoidea [5] and bees [20]. We conﬁrm the placement of Ampulicidae as sister to the remaining Apoidea and the placement of bees as sister to the crabronid subfamilies Philanthinae+Pemphredoninae. The close afﬁnities of bees to the crabronid subfamilies Philanthinae and Pemphredoninae have been suggested previously in studies based both on morphological and molecular data (reviewed in [5]). Philanthinae include ground-nesting wasps that hunt a variety of prey, including beetles, ants, and, ironically, bees. Pemphredoninae include small, mostly cavity-nesting wasps that hunt diverse prey, including Collembola (springtails), Thysanoptera (thrips), and an array of plant-feeding Hemiptera (aphids, scales, psyllids, cicadellids, cercopids, and membracids). Together, Pemphre- doninae and Philanthinae comprise just over 2,200 described species [26]. That the bees, with over 20,000 described species, are sister to a group of just 2,200 hunting wasp species would suggest that the switch from predation to pollenivory was a sig- niﬁcant driver of diversiﬁcation in bees. Future studies should include an even broader sampling of Pemphredoninae and Phi- lanthinae to test this hypothesis. Within bees, our results provide further conﬁrmation that Me- littidae, previously thought to be sister to long-tongued bees (Apidae+Megachilidae) based on morphology [27], is monophy- letic and sister to the remaining bee families. Family-level rela- tionships in bees are fully congruent with previous studies [20]. It is notable that most of our analyses recovered the eusocial cor- biculate bees (honeybees, bumblebees, and stingless bees) as monophyletic and sister to the weakly social Euglossini (orchid bees), thus favoring a single origin of eusociality within the group. Relationships among these taxa have been controversial, but our result agrees with a recent phylogenomic study that found that controlling for base-compositional heterogeneity favored mono- phyly of eusocial corbiculates [28]. Conclusions The coupling of NGS with reduced representation phylogenom- ics has driven a revolution in molecular systematics, making it possible to generate large datasets at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods [29, 30]. Here, we further applied one prom- ising approach, the targeted enrichment of UCEs [12], to the megadiverse insect order Hymenoptera, greatly extending a pre- vious study that ﬁrst employed the UCE method in arthropods [7]. We focused on family-level relationships of the stinging wasps (Aculeata) and produced a robust backbone phylogeny that provides many insights into the evolutionary history of this group. In addition, by carrying out a series of taxon-sampling ex- periments, we have demonstrated that even in the era of phylo- genomics, careful taxon sampling can be of critical importance, with both outgroup choice and taxon evenness having a signiﬁ- cant impact on topology and bootstrap support. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES UCE Sequencing Workﬂow and Bioinformatics The protocols for generating UCE data followed those reported in Faircloth et al. [7] and are described in detail in the Supplemental Experimental Pro- cedures. For newly sampled taxa, we performed the following steps: DNA extraction, library preparation, sample pooling, UCE enrichment, enrichment veriﬁcation, ﬁnal pooling, and Illumina sequencing. For all bioinformatics steps, from read cleaning to alignment, we used the PHYLUCE v1.5 software package [31]. Phylogenomic Analyses of the Complete Taxon Set Using the Hym-187T-F75 locus set, we carried out ML and BI analyses on the concatenated matrix with the programs RAxML v8 [16] and ExaBayes v1.4 [17], respectively (additional analytical details are in the Supplemental Exper- imental Procedures). For ML searches, we compared the following partitioning schemes: (1) unpartitioned, (2) partitioned by locus, (3) partitioned with the hcluster algorithm in PartitionFinder v1 [32] (data pre-partitioned by locus), (4) partitioned with the rcluster algorithm in PartitionFinder v2 [33], and (5) par- titioned with the k-means algorithm [34] in PartitionFinder v2. For the BI anal- ysis, we used the k-means partitioning scheme because this scheme resulted in the highest log likelihood in ML analyses (see Data S1 for partitioning re- sults). For ST analysis, we used the summary method implemented in ASTRAL-II v4.8.0 [18] and employed weighted statistical binning [19], which was developed to reduce ST inference error caused by the inclusion of loci that have few informative sites. To further test our results and to remove potential data biases, we carried out two additional analyses on the Hym-187T-75T locus set using RAxML. For the ﬁrst analysis, we converted the concatenated matrix to RY coding, and for the second analysis, we used the program BaCoCa v1.1 [35] to identify and remove loci deviating signiﬁcantly (p < 0.01) from base composition homo- geneity among taxa. The latter analysis identiﬁed 47 offending loci, leaving 807 loci for concatenation and analysis (‘‘Hym-187T-F75-BComp’’). Divergence Dating We employed node dating and used the program BEAST v1.8.2 [36] to esti- mate divergence dates on the complete 187-taxon tree. To calibrate the anal- ysis, we used 37 fossils representing taxa from across Hymenoptera and one secondary calibration (252 Ma; taken from [37]) for the root node (see Data S1 for calibration information). For Aculeata, we selected a subset of the fossils used in two recent molecular studies [38, 39]. Importantly, we included the oldest known fossils for bees (Melittosphex burmensis), ants (Haidomyrmex A B C D Figure 2.

We used the Fossilworks database [40](http:// www.fossilworks.org) to date fossils, and we followed best practices for node dating [41]. To decrease computation time in BEAST, we used a constraint topology, and we tested three different locus sets: (1) 25 best loci (where ‘‘best’’ indicates the highest mean gene-tree bootstrap score), (2) 50 best loci, and (3) 50 randomly selected loci.

The matrix name indicates whether the taxon set is a version of Johnson et al. [6], Faircloth et al. [7], or this study (Hym-). Three different topologies were recovered: ants sister to Apoidea (A); ants sister to all other aculeate superfamilies, except Chrysidoidea (B); and ants sister to Apoidea+Scoliodea (C). Bootstrap support in- dicates support for the clade that includes ants plus its sister group. Topologies correspond to those shown in Figures 1A–1C, in relation to the position of ants only.
