What the module covers:  Demonstrate knowledge of how ecosystems and their component parts function  Understand the ecological theory relevant to successful conservation.  Understand and recognise the need for conservation of species and habitats.  Understand the evolutionary theory relevant to successful conservation.  Develop an understanding of field surveying skills relevant to conservation Why study Ecology and Conservation?

Field Report (50% of module) • You will choose what you study. It could be just birds based on song, plant phenology or both. • Phenology is the study of how an organism’s life cycle changes seasonally. • You will collect and document data and then write a short synthesis based on your key findings based on plant and animal changes from the winter to spring. What is phenology? • Phenology is the study of how an organism’s life cycle changes seasonally. • A changing climate will alter the phenology of different organisms. • Climate represents the weather conditions of a location over period of ~60 years. Why is phenology important? • Milder winters and a change in climate could result in earlier bud burst for some plant species. • A change in the phenology of plants and insects could affect the food sources (plants and insects) and habitats of arriving migratory species. Access to Parc Penglais Botany Gardens Entrance Data collection • You will document the change in biota (specifically plants and animals) over a period from the winter to spring period at Aberystwyth. Parc penglais You may include: • Details about daylength, general weather conditions and any other relevant factors. • A weekly list of birds (based on song) tree bud burst or both. • Other relevant data that you may want to collect. Data collection • You should spend ~1 hour weekly on this activity. • We suggest that you focus on the Parc Penglais area. • Please do not survey alone, wear appropriate footwear and clothing. • You can do this activity in small groups but must write up your report independently. Data collection • Be aware of daylength and do not survey when it is dark • Fit this activity around your daily timetable. • It is best to survey bird song before your first lecture of the morning. • Act responsibly and not suspiciously in the field and respect others. • To survey wildlife, keep to the paths and be silent. Field Report (50%) • Word count is up to 1000 words allowing scope for those that want to include more to do so via an Appendix. • It should contain a Synthesis section where you have the opportunity to collate any findings, present any data in graphical form and discuss your results in relation to the literature. Structure of Report Week 1(starting 12th of February 2024) Week 2 (starting 19th of February 2024) Week 3 (starting 26th of February 2024) Week 4 (starting 4th of March 2024) -RWk Week 5 (starting 11h of March 2024) Week 6 (starting 18th of March 2024) Synthesis EXAMPLE Week 1(starting 12th of February 2024) • Sunrise: Sunset: • Temperature (Min): Temperature (Max): • General weather conditions: wet and cloudy overcast week • Birds heard singing (with location): Chifchaff (Penglais woods), Robin (Student village), Blue Tit (Town). • Tree inspected and their development states: Beech (Buds), Oak (Buds), Birch (Buds) – all dormant / 0% bud burst. • Other observations: You will also complete Week 2 (starting 19th of February 2024) Insert details Week 3 (starting 26th of February 2024) Insert details Week 4 (starting 4th of March 2024) Insert details Week 5 (starting 11th of March 2024) Insert details Synthesis section • You may decide to compare the development of trees species (% bud burst) over time, consulting with the literature to assess whether what you found was expected. • Similarly, you might discuss native versus migratory bird species early and late arrivals to the UK. Assessment deadlines • Submit Field Report by 12.00 Mid-day on Tuesday 16th of April 2024. This will be submitted as a word document to Turnitin. Summary • Introduced the module content and assessments. • Provided an overview on “Why study Ecology and Conservation” • Gave an initial introduction into the practical assessment. • Introduced phenology.","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":""}
