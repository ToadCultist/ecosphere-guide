Botany Practical Report Ecological adaptations of three plant species to drought Bryophyllum daigremontianum* ‘xerophyte’ Iris pseudacorus: ‘hydrophyte’ Vicia faba: ‘mesophyte’ Experiment on freshwater, crop & arid region species *synonym’ Kalanchoë daigremontiana Introduction • Give an overview of the area • Could include details of why studying drought response is important • A brief overview of the 3 species • Clearly state your objectives in the final paragraph Materials and Methods Materials • List the 3 species used and state that there were two groups; control and drought treatment (state length of drought). • State that mature plants were used and that were grown in a glasshouse • Do not list equipment! Methods • Describe the method used concisely but in sufficient detail how the work was conducted • Describe experiments in past tense – e.g. water was added… • Presented in flowing paragraphs - do not use numbered or bullet pointed lists • Never say \"you\", “I” or “we” Results • Class data available in the Excel spreadsheet • Use Excel to: • Calculate summary statistics for the fresh (Wf) and turgid (Wt) weight for each species and treatment. • Mean: =AVERAGE(range) • Standard Deviation: =STDEV.P(range) • Minimum: =MIN(range) • Maximum: =MAX(range) • Number of data points: =COUNT(range) RWC% • Calculate Relative Water content: • RWC% = 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊 × 100 • Expresses the fresh weight (Wf) as a percentage of the turgid (fully hydrated) weight (Wt) • Gives a normalised value between 0-100% that allows comparing water status across different plant samples/species. • If Wf = Wt, then RWC = 100%, meaning the tissue was fully hydrated when sampled. • If Wf < Wt, then RWC < 100%, indicating some degree of water deficit in the tissue when sampled. Plot your RWC data • Don’t use bar charts! • Use box plots instead • BoxPlotR: a web-tool for generation of box plots • http://shiny.chemgrid.org/boxplotr/ • Upper whisker: The maximum value in the data set, excluding any potential outliers. • 3rd quartile: The 75th percentile value, where 75% of the data points are less than or equal to this value. • Median: The middle value that separates the higher and lower halves of the data set. • Mean: The average value of the data set, calculated by summing all data points and dividing by the number of data points. • 1st quartile: The 25th percentile value, where 25% of the data points are less than or equal to this value. • Lower whisker: The minimum value in the data set, excluding any potential outliers. p-value • A p-value is a statistical measure used to determine if the results of an experiment are statistically significant. • It represents the probability of obtaining the observed data if the null hypothesis (no effect or difference) is true. • If the p-value is less than or equal to 0.05, the results ARE deemed statistically significant, meaning the likelihood of the observed data occurring by random chance is less than 5%. • Reject the null-hypothesis, and accept the alternative – there is an effect or difference • If the p-value is greater than 0.05, the results ARE NOT deemed statistically significant • Accept the null-hypothesis – there is no effect or difference Statistics – t-test • A t-test is a statistical test that compares the means of two groups to determine if there is a significant difference between them. • Use it to compare the RWC of control and drought treatment for EACH species • Use the t-test calculator on GraphPad • https://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/ttest1/?format=C • There was/ was not a significant difference between the control and treatment group for V. faba (t-test, p = 0.0XX) • A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a statistical method used to compare the means of three or more independent groups to determine if there are any statistically significant differences between them. • Use one-way ANOVA to • Compare RWC of controls • Compare RWC of treatments • http://vassarstats.net/anova1u.html • The Tukey HSD (Honestly Significant Difference) Test is a post-hoc test used after an ANOVA • Used to determine which specific groups differ from each other by making pairwise comparisons between group means Statistics – ANOVATables and Figures • Tables should have a brief descriptive title BEFORE the table • Table 1. Summary data for three drought treated plant species. • Figures should have a legend AFTER the figure. • Figure 1. Box plot… • Do NOT show the same data twice! Discussion • Present results in the Results section and discuss them in the Discussion • Review of the results in the context of existing knowledge. • Did you find anything unexpected • Return to the points raised in the introduction • Have your aims and objectives been met? • Try to comment on any limitations in experiment. • Suggest further experiments • End with concluding paragraph • Do NOT introduce any new ideas here! Referencing • All statements should be supported by an appropriate citation • Try to use only peer reviewed work • Avoid citing websites • End with a reference list • Ensure the referencing is consistent • Ensure Latin names are italicised","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
