Weinman et al (2009) results: % Correct % Incorrect Heart 47 54 Lungs 31 69 Stomach 38 62 Intestines 86 14 Bladder 81 19 Thyroid 42 58 Liver 53 47 Kidneys 43 58 Basic anatomy ‘baffles Britons’ BBC News, 12 June 2009 United States (2010) (n = 1,932) EU (2005) (n =16,029) Russia (2003) (n = 2,107) % Correct % Incorrect % Correct % Incorrect % Correct % Incorrect Ordinary tomatoes do not contain genes, while genetically modified tomatoes do 47 53 41 59 22 78 Antibiotics kill viruses as well as bacteria. 50 50 46 54 18 82 Basic Biology Baffles the WorldWhat has “conventional” plant breeding achieved? • Yield increases typically 3-fold this century via: • Increased harvest index • Increased length of growing cycle • Reliability • Resistance to abiotic and biotic stress • Increased range of cultivation • Will NOT be replaced by GM or gene editing Many names, same principle… • Genetically Modified (GM), Genetically Manipulated (GM), Genetically Modified Organism (GMO), Living modified organism (LMO), Genetically Engineered (GE), Transgenic, etc. • GMOs are officially defined in the EU legislation as: • \"organisms in which the genetic material (DNA) has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally by mating and/or recombination.\" ‘Pesticide’ chemicals → control weeds, insects, fungi • Post-war era of synthetic pesticides • Research institute in Hertfordshire: field experiment on wheat yields since 1856 • Lines: global average crop yield per area 1960-2004 • Bars: global pesticide use 15-20× • Herbicides (‘weedkillers’): biggest market ‘Pesticide’ chemicals → control weeds, insects, fungi‘Pesticide’ chemicals: do they help? • Global average effectiveness of pest controls for 11 crops • Weed controls relatively effective Herbicides: different cellular targets Finale 150 - contains glufosinate, an irreversible glutamine synthetase inhibitor produced by certain Streptomyces bacteria. Auxin herbicides disrupt cell growth in dicot weeds but grass less sensitive. • Inhibits ‘EPSP’* synthase of ‘shikimate pathway’ • EPSP needed for biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids, flavonoids, lignin, auxin Roundup® active component: ‘glyphosate’ • Glycine phosphonate *5-enol-pyruvyl-shikimate-3-phosphate  • Glyphosate-resistant bacterial strain ‘CP4’ isolated from glyphosate production waste • CP4 EPSP synthase: Gly→Ala mutation at active site allows normal reaction but glyphosate does not interfere Discovery of glyphosate-resistant EPSP synthase • Genetically modify crop plants with CP4 EPSP synthase gene → glyphosate-resistant crops Glyphosate ✓  To make a GM crops we need: •Defined gene sequences of known function • Or synthesised artificially (synthetic biology) •Effective vectors including promoters, targeting sequences, terminators and selectable markers •Effective transformation systems. Common methods • Soil bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens is the causal agent of crown gall disease • A. tumefaciens infects the plant through its Ti plasmid. The Ti plasmid integrates a segment of its DNA, known as T-DNA, into the chromosomal DNA of its host plant cells • Gene gun or a biolistic particle delivery system, is a device for injecting cells with DNA. The payload is an elemental particle of a heavy metal coated with plasmid DNA. Agrobacterium method Particle gun method Agrobacterium tumefaciens Ti plasmid carrying desired genes Particles coated with DNA encoding desired genes Particle gun Bombardment of plant pieces with particles Cocultivation of Agrobacterium with plant pieces DNA transferred to plant cells Chromosome with integrated DNA encoding desired genes Plant cell Nucleus Cell multiplication (callus) Shoot regeneration followed by root regeneration Plant with new trait 1996: Monsanto develop ‘Roundup-Ready®’ soybean, maize, cotton 1996: Monsanto develop ‘Roundup-Ready®’ soybean, maize, cotton By 10 years later, almost all soybean in USA was Roundup- Ready ‘Roundup-Ready®’ crops sprayed with glyphosate to keep clear of weeds ‘Roundup-Ready®’ crops sprayed with glyphosate to keep clear of weeds 1995-2014: 9× in agricultural glyphosate use in US (15× globally) Benbrook (2016) Environ. Sci. Eur. 28: 3 Glyphosate-resistant weeds Glyphosate resistant grass weed infesting Roundup-Ready soybean in Argentina • Since 1974, 8.6 billion kg of glyphosate have been applied globally • 16 glyphosate-resistant weed species in Roundup-Ready® cropping systems • One resistance mechanism is over- production of EPSP synthase http://www.weedscience.org Another GM example: ‘Bt’ cotton Cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera caterpillar on cotton • ‘Cotton bollworm’ moth: worst single insect pest costing >$5 billion annually • ‘Bt’ toxin gene (cloned from bacteria) in Monsanto’s ‘Bollgard II’ GM cotton • Used as organic pesticide • ≈80% global cotton GM Source: http://www.isaaa.org Hernández-Fernández & López-Pazos (2011). ‘Bt’ toxin lyses insect gut cells Bt crops • “Cry” genes produce d-endotoxin crystals are solubilised in midgut and activated by proteolysis • Only functional part of gene used • Optimised for plant expression • Plants produce endotoxin • Only feeding insects killed Watson et al. (1997) Which traits are engineered? • >30 traits currently engineered for commercial use • Most popular are herbicide tolerance, insect resistance and both together • Many other examples, e.g., papaya ringspot virus resistance or anthocyanin-rich biotech pink pineapple Where are GM crops grown? Why do farmers choose to grow GM crops? Positive impacts of GM cropsHawaii: papaya ringspot virus (PRSV) 1992-1997 • Virus spread by aphids kills trees • Production halved by end decade Healthy Infected Abandoned plantationwww.biofortified.org/inf o/gmo/virus Transgenic papaya with a PRSV gene • ‘Rainbow’: GM papayas • Now 85% of Hawaiian papaya crop 1998 launch at Hawaiian celebration • Cornell University transferred virus resistance gene into Thai varieties of papaya • 2004 field trials established in Thailand. • Local farmers ‘stole’ the fruit from the research stations • Greenpeace launches a campaign against the GM plants • Thai government destroys all the plants ThailandWhat is genome editing? • Definition: techniques for genome engineering that involve DNA repair mechanisms and/or replication for incorporating site-specific modification into a genomic DNA. Genome engineering = process of introducing intentional changes into genomic DNA (ISO/DIS 5058-1). • Meganucleases (MN) • Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFN) • Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN) • Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) coupled with a CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) • Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (ODM) • Site-directed mutagenesis technique but does not use a targeted exonuclease Lighting Rise of Genome Editing (GE) • CRISPR/Cas system initially discovered E. coli genome in 1987, adapted system used to edited human and mouse cells in 2013 • First GE humans born in China in October 2018 – twins Lulu and Nana (researcher fined and imprisoned) • First GE crop grown in USA in 2019 • Cibus’ ultra-high-oleic oil canola • GE organism still classed as a GMO in EU, but not England GABA-enriched tomato is first CRISPR-edited food to enter market • Increased the amount of GABA in tomato • GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is a neurotransmitter, a chemical messenger produced by the brain and nervous system. • Sanatech do not to claim that its tomatoes therapeutically lower blood pressure and promote relaxation. • Do advertise that consuming GABA, generally, can achieve these effects and that its tomatoes contain high levels of GABA. Waltz (2022) Summary • ‘GM’ plants altered in a way that does not occur naturally by mating and/or recombination • Major GM crops exploit pesticide technologies but diverse GM products appearing • Gene edited crops have reached market and soon to land in the UK Image acknowledgments Wikimedia Commons, https://commons.wikimedia.org Rothamsted Research, https://www.rothamsted.ac.uk Oerke (2006) Journal of Agricultural Science 144: 31-43 Délye et al.
