Benton et al. (2022) Evolution of pollinator insects • Cretaceous radiations of flower-visiting flies, bees, wasps & butterflies • Co-evolution with Cretaceous flowers Archaic insects? Coleoptera Diptera HymenopteraLepidoptera Cenozoic Cretaceous Jurassic Triassic Permian Carboniferous Include generalist pollinators Include specialist pollinators Angiosperm innovations • Bisexual flowers: more efficient with pollinator animals? • Enclosure of ovules in carpels to reduce self- pollination? Sepal Petal Stamen Carpel Arabidopsis thaliana Sepal Petal StamenArabidopsis thaliana Pollen Sepal Petal Stamen Carpel Arabidopsis thaliana Stigma Floral rewards for pollinators • Pollen: ~40% each of sugars & protein • Nectar specifically to offer sugar to pollinators • Nectaries at base of flower so pollinator brushes past anthers & stigmas • Nectaries often too tiny for field identification Petal Sepal Nectary Angiosperm life cycle • Alternation of sporophyte & gametophyte generations • Microscopic gametophytes in ovule & pollen • Male gametophyte = pollen grain, consisting of only a few cells • Female gametophyte = embryo sac, contained within the ovule Petal Sepal ‘Double fertilization’ unique to angiosperms • Evolved once • Pollen grain lands on the stigma, pollen tube germination occurs that grows through the style and into the ovule. • One sperm + two haploid ‘polar nuclei’ → triploid nutritive ‘endosperm’ • One sperm fertilizes egg to form diploid zygote • Basal angiosperms: 86% insect-pollinated • Mostly by beetles or flies (not specially adapted) • 76% of Cretaceous fossil pollens show insect- pollination features (large, not smooth, clumped) Evidence for insect-pollination of ancestral angiosperms Basal (‘primitive’) angiosperms Animal pollinators: Insects • Two-thirds of the ~250,000 angiosperms are insect- pollinated • Hymenoptera - Bees are most common pollinators ‘DNA barcoding’ to identify flowers visited by bees C.
