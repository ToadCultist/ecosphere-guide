The capacity to amplify many copies of a gene opened up new horizons in terms of, for instance, identifying genes, genotypes and organisms. Nowadays, PCR is one of the basic tools that molecular biologists use. It is used in forensic, medical, botanical and veterinary sciences and also in the food industry [CITATION TDG07 \\l 1045 ]. Restriction enzymes are cutting DNA. They cut DNA at their specific target sequences – restriction sites. Enzymes can produce sticky or blunt DNA ends. EcoRI recognises following sequence: GAATTC. It cuts after the G from the 5’ end. Thanks to restriction enzymes we can create recombinant organisms, which contain DNA from at least two different species. Usually, the bacterial plasmid is joined with another piece of DNA. Restriction enzymes can be also used in gene sequencing by determining the order of restriction sites in genomes. DNA topoisomerases are also important in today’s molecular biology. They can ligate an insert into a vector, and it takes only 5 minutes. No DNA ligases are needed. Topoisomerases are used in the clinical field, for example, many drugs operate by interfering with topoisomerases [ CITATION Pom10 \\l 1045 ]. In this study we identified (using different molecular biology methods, including PCR) which of the provided E. Coli strains contained cloned DNA and what that cloned DNA is. Methods Materials For this experiment following products were used: TOPO TA PCR-based cloning kit from Invitrogen, EcoRI solution and Fast DNA Ladder from New England BioLabs. Preparation There were two strains provided: white and blue. Selective plates with LB agar (containing ampicillin, kanamycin and X-gal) were prepared. Fresh cultures of blue and white bacteria were set up. Extraction of plasmid DNA from White and Blue cultures 1.5 ml of each culture was transferred into an Eppendorf tube. Cultures were subjected to centrifugation for 2 minutes. The supernatant was disposed, and the pellet resuspended in 250 l of buffer P1. Then, 250 l of buffer P2 and 300 l of buffer N3 were added. Eppendorf tubes were subjected to maximum speed centrifugation for 10 minutes. 750 l of the supernatant was collected and transferred to a spin column within a collection tube. Collection tubes were subjected to centrifugation for 1 minute. The flow-through was discarded. 0.5 ml of buffer PW1 was added to the column and the collection tubes were subjected to centrifugation for 1 minute. 0.6 ml of buffer PW2 was added to the column and Downloaded by Bingus Gremp (gixef50071@togito.com) lOMoARcPSD|41056320 the collection tubes were subjected to centrifugation for 1 minute. The collection tube was replaced with a fresh one and subjected to centrifugation for 2 minutes. The collection tube was replaced again. 50 l of buffer EBP was added directly onto the silica filter. Collection tubes were subjected to centrifugation for 2 minutes. Eluents were transferred to Eppendorf tubes and left on ice. Plasmid restriction 5 l of plasmid DNA and 5 l of EcoRI solution (RE buffer (10x): water: EcoRI at a ratio 1:3:1) were mixed in Eppendorf tubes for each of the plasmids. Eppendorf tubes were incubated for an hour and then put on ice. PCR A 100-fold dilution for each plasmid was made. 2 l of diluted plasmid DNA and 48 l of PCR mix (containing 2 l of primer mix, 21 l of water and 25 l of PCR Master Mix (2x) per 48 l) were mixed. The PCR reaction was performed overnight. DNA electrophoresis 5 samples were prepared: Ladder, pBlueEcoRI, pWhiteEcoRI, pBluePCR and pWhitePCR. Each sample consisted of 10 l of DNA and 2 l of dark blue loading buffer (6x). Samples were loaded onto the gel and 100 V were applied. After 1 hour the voltage was reduced to run the gel overnight. After running the gel overnight, it was soaked for 30 minutes in ethidium bromide. Transformation of E. coli Two Eppendorf tubes with 2 l of undiluted plasmids were prepared. To both tubes 10 l of competent E. coli from the ice bath was added and then kept on ice for 10 minutes. Then the tubes were transferred to a 42 oC water bath for 2 minutes and put back onto ice. 1 ml of LB culture medium was added to each tube. The tubes were incubated for 1 hour at 37 oC with vigorous shaking. After the incubation, the tubes were subjected to centrifugation for 1 minute. The supernatants were removed and discarded. Each pellet was resuspended in 10 l of LB and spotted onto the centre of the plate. A drop of liquid was spread over the surface of each plate. The plates were incubated overnight at 37 oC. Sequence analysis PCR product derived from the insert in the plasmid extracted from strain white was sequenced. The piece of the sequence in between EcoRI recognition sites was cut out. The cut-out sequence was put into BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool). Proteins matching the DNA sequence were found.

Gel Electrophoresis There is one piece of restricted plasmid DNA of blue bacteria, whereas there are two pieces of restricted plasmid DNA of white bacteria (Figure 1.). That means that blue bacteria have nothing inserted in between EcoRI restriction sites and white bacteria do have an insert. PCR plasmid of blue bacteria is shorter than PCR plasmid of white bacteria (Figure 1.). It is because the blue bacteria plasmid does not have an insert. Transformation Competent E. coli were transformed (Figure 2.). In average, there were about 50 successful transformations per plate (Figure 3.). There were some white bacteria on blue-bacteria plates but there were no blue bacteria in white bacteria plates. It is a result of contaminating the plates. Sequence analysis The inserted DNA sequence was matched using BLAST with type I glyceraldehyde-3- phosphate dehydrogenase. It is most likely to be from Myxococcus xanthus (Figure 4.). Figure 1.

The plasmid of E. coli contains a gene that makes an enzyme (-Galactosidase) to break down X-gal. X-gal breaks down to galactose and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-hydroxyindole. The second of these products is blue. The multiple cloning site, where a gene may be attached, is located within the lacZ gene. E. coli plasmid without an insert has an active lacZ gene, therefore X-gal can be broken down and the blue product is released. In plasmid with an insert lacZ gene is interrupted by PCR insert, so the enzyme is not made and X-gal is not broken down which leaves white colouration. LB agar besides X-gal contains kanamycin and ampicillin. Bacteria with plasmid, with or without the PCR insert, are resistant to those antibiotics. E. coli without any plasmid will not grow, because they are going to be killed by kanamycin and ampicillin. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is an enzyme that catalyses the sixth step of glycolysis. It catalyses the conversion of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to D-glycerate 1,3-bisphosphate. It also has some non-metabolic functions, for example, it initiates apoptosis [CITATION ATa071 \\l 1045 ] and provides energy for fast axonal transport [CITATION Dia13 \\l 1045 ]. GAPDH has also clinical significance. It is overexpressed in numerous human cancers, for example melanoma. Its’ expression causes tumour progression [CITATION DAV15 \\l 1045 ]. It is also implied that GAPDH is involved in some neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) or Alzheimer’s disease [CITATION All12 \\l 1045 ]. There are things worth improving in this experiment. Some of the LB plates for transformation were contaminated with the white strain of E. coli. It resulted in plates containing both blue and white coloured bacteria. The simplest way to get rid of this error is to use aseptic techniques while handling microorganisms. Also, there were big variations in terms of the number of colonies per plate. The numbers fluctuate between 0 and 568 on the white-strain plates, and between 0 and 355 on the blue-strain plates. This might have been caused by human error. Some of the samples might have been more diluted than others which could cause these fluctuations. This error can be avoided by following the procedures and not getting distracted while pipetting the solutes. We have established that the white strain of E. coli contains cloned DNA. That DNA is coding for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and it is most probably derived from Myxococcus xanthus.
