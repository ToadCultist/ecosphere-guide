Glasshouse Practical Bryophyllum daigremontianum ‘xerophyte’ Iris pseudacorus: ‘hydrophyte’ Vicia faba: ‘mesophyte’ Experiment on freshwater, crop & arid region species Ecological adaptations of 3 plant species to drought ‘ABA’ & events in drought stressed plants Water provided: ABA increases Water withheld: Stomata close Stomata re-open ABA returns to normal ABA = Abscisic acid (plant hormone) Hydrophobic (water-repellent) ‘cuticle’ Water conservation: waterproof leaf surface ‘Cutin’ is complex aliphatic biopolymer Echeveria Water conservation: succulent leaves • Waxy leaves • Store water in fleshy leaves • Reduce transpiration • Modified photosynthesis Pine ‘needles’ Water conservation: minimize leaf surface Water conservation: minimize leaf surface Pine ‘needle’ Ammophila arenaria (marram grass) Water conservation: rolled leaves • Lithops \"living stones\" • Native to southern Africa • Camouflage to protection against herbivores. • Grow mostly underground with just the leaf pair exposed Water conservation: succulent leavesWater conservation succulent stems • Stem photosynthesis: reduced surface area limit transpiration • Waxy cuticle: prevents excessive transpiration. • Stomata: sunken into stem surfaces • Nocturnal stomatal opening • Extensive shallow root system: • Water storage: The stem tissue of cacti is adapted to store large amounts of water, • Spines and hairs • Help shade the stem • Collect dew • Protection from herbivores • CAM photosynthesis: use a specialized photosynthetic Summary • Root hairs:  surface contact with soil • Plants need 16 minerals as well as H2O • ‘Mycorrhizae’: fungal symbioses in roots • Root ‘endodermis’ waterproofed so solutes → cell membranes, not just wall spaces • ‘Cohesion-tension’ model envisages xylem transport as ‘wick’ mechanism • H2O conservation: ‘cuticle’, succulence, needle or rolled leaves Image acknowledgments Campbell & Reece (2008) Biology, 8th edn.
