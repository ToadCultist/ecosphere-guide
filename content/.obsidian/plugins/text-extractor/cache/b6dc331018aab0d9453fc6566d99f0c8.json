Word/length limit Aim for 2,000 words Learning Outcomes to be addressed by the coursework:  Communicate information and ideas in the form of written reports and oral group presentations.  Develop a reasoned argument and challenge assumptions.  Identify appropriate data sources and information resources.  Interpret and use data.  Follow an experimental protocol  Record, interpret and report experimental data appropriately  Instil appropriate academic conduct (e.g. avoiding unacceptable practice).  Demonstrate basic computer literacy.  Present data/concepts through a variety of media Written assignments MUST be in your own words. Do NOT take short cuts by copying even the smallest amount of material from anywhere (including the internet, books or another student’s text). This is plagiarism and will be detected. N.B. Presenting work generated by AI as if it were your own is Unacceptable Academic Practice and you must not do this. AU procedures and penalties for 'Unacceptable Academic Practice' are strict and some may prevent you from qualifying for your degree see:https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/academic-registry/handbook/regulations/uap/ Electronic Submission  (1) Save your work in Microsoft Office or PDF format. (2) Upload the file to Turnitin by selecting‘Upload’. (3) Check the file submitted is the correct one and the formatting on the preview page is correct. (4) Complete your submission by selecting ‘Submit’ and await an email ‘Confirmation receipt’. Keep this as proof of your submission.  Please note that the ‘Blackboard Assignment’ submission points do not provide receipts.  Unless otherwise noted above, Turnitin allows you to overwrite your submissions. You are advised to submit your work at least once as a draft well before the deadline in case of last minute problems.  Failure to follow this advice may result in a mark of zero if your submission is not uploaded or is in an unreadable format. Page 1 of 4 Cyfadran y GwyddorayDaear a Bywyd / Faculty of Earth and Life Sciences Clarification of coursework brief It is your responsibility to ensure that you understand the requirements of the coursework that has been set. AU staff policy is to reply to emails within three working days so you should not expect a response in time to help if you ask for guidance less than three days before the deadline. University policy on late/non-submission Work submitted after the deadline without an extension will be given a mark of zero. Extension to coursework deadlines Extensions may be awarded in exceptional circumstances, e.g. on medical grounds, or for genuine, unforeseen personal circumstances such as illness, family problems or death of a relative or close personal friend. You may apply for an extension using the Extension Request Form available to download from the ‘Undergraduate Information’ or ‘Information for Taught PG Students’ module on Blackboard. This should be submitted together with any supporting documentary evidence such as a medical certificate to fsestaff@aber.ac.uk or your department office. In order to be awarded an extension, students should inform the department (with appropriate evidence) three working days before the deadline. If insufficient evidence is submitted then the extension will be awarded subject to evidence being provided by a given date. Failure of computers, printers and backups etc. will not be accepted as reasons for late submission of assessed work. Please refer to your handbook for further information on Coursework Extensions. If an extension has not been confirmed, then you should always submit an attempt of the work by the deadline. Page 2 of 4 Cyfadran y GwyddorayDaear a Bywyd / Faculty of Earth and Life Sciences BR16820 PRACTICAL REPORT ASSIGNMENT BRIEF Lab write up: You should write up your lab work encompassing all aspects of the practical sessions. Additional data will be provided on Blackboard in the “Assignments” folder to complete the write up, including DNA sequence data and images of electrophoresis gels. This should incorporate an abstract, introduction, methods section, a results section, a discussion and reference list. Abstract A very succinct summary of the entire report. It should be around four sentences long and explain what was done and why, the results obtained and their interpretation/significance. Introduction Explain (with referencing) the revolutionary importance of molecular biology methods and their applications. Describe how PCR, restriction enzymes and DNA sequencing can be applied in a forensic fashion to identify and characterise pieces of DNA, and introduce the purpose of the experiments undertaken. Methods: Write concisely, referring to publicly accessible protocols and provide only a brief overview of the methods used (for example ‘alkaline lysis’ was the method used to lyse cells to release their DNA). Remember to include information on sequence analysis software, graph producing software and statistical analysis. Results: For each experimental elements, write an introductory sentence to explain the experiment aim and then describe the results in a logical manner: - DESCRIBE, DO NOT DISCUSS, THE RESULTS. For instance, for the gel results you should report the number of bands and their apparent size. The significance of those observations should be explained in the discussion. - Include specific numbers into your results – for example “base pair 471 showed a difference of C ->T (see figure 4)”. - Always reference your Figures in text “(Figure 1)”. - Label your axis/annotate figures (consider the ladder). - Include units (and add a space before units –“24 ml” not “24ml”. - Always have figure legends below figures. Do not title them “A figure showing a gel showing PCR results”, rather “Figure 2: DNA gel electrophoresis of PCR products”. Page 3 of 4 Cyfadran y GwyddorayDaear a Bywyd / Faculty of Earth and Life Sciences - While figures have titles below, Tables have titles above. Explain ALL results, including the gel result, the transformation data and the DNA sequence analysis. What conclusions can be drawn from your results? Discussion: This section should place your findings in context. The discussion should both discuss the experiments conducted and the wider field of molecular biology. Do your results agree with what you’d expect from the literature? What are the limitations of the approaches used, and how could they be overcome? You should also discuss the use of these technologies (PCR, SNPs, cloning sequences into vectors etc.) in biotech, but try to keep focused, using a small number of relevant examples. Use primary literature throughout. References: Please include the references cited within the body of the text and incorporate a full reference list. OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR A PASS WOULD BE A MINIMIUM OF 10 REFERENCES, INCLUDING 5 PRIMARY RESEARCH PAPERS (not reviews) TO BE CITED Assessment Criteria Specified assessment criteria will be used to evaluate your submitted coursework. The criteria used for this piece of work will include: Literature, Scholarship, and Structure. A full description of each of the assessment criteria, including the different levels of attainment (between 0 and 100%) are available in the Department of Life Sciences Undergraduate Information DEPT-I-UG-O folder on Blackboard. You can also access the assessment criteria for your assignment by following the instructions in the following FAQ: https://faqs.aber.ac.uk/index.php?id=9271 NOTE: The assessment criteria levels of attainment are not used to calculate your mark, they provide formative feedback for you to see how you could improve your work. In addition to this formative feedback, you will also be provided with written or recorded comments from your marker. Page 4 of 4","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
