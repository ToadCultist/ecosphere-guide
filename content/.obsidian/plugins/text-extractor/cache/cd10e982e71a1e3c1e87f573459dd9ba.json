You need your student number • You will need a HB pencil to complete the MCQ sheet • Predecessor modules - BR12110 (Microbiol diversity) and BR13610 (Green Planet). Up to 2017 plant element was taught in 20 credit module (BR12920) with Ecology. • There are no past paper for 2020-23 due to exams being online. • Due to staff changes on the plant part of BR19920, there are likely more changes here (compared to previous years). Microbiology part more stable (no staff changes). BR19920 Exam MCQExample MCQs • The lag phase of a bacterial culture occurs due to a) Oxygen limitation b) Nutrient limitation c) Cell death d) Bacteriophage infection e) The need to adapt to a new environment • Which of these frugivores is the main agent for angiosperm seed dispersal? a) Fruit bats b) Elephants c) Primates d) Birds e) Ants Example Essay • Write an essay, using named examples, about the different types of viruses that exist and how they vary in their genetic composition and structure (from BR12110) • Detail the process that plants use to transport water Preparing For Written Examinations in an Examination Hall at Aberystwyth University https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/media/departmental/academicregistry/ugissues/Preparing- for-Examinations-S1-2024-FINAL.pdf BR19920 Angiosperm Biodiversity Dr Dylan Phillips (dwp@aber.ac.uk) Objectives By end of lecture, you should understand: • Taxonomic ranks of plants • The utility of the ‘family’ rank • Types of features characteristic of families • The nature of ‘monocots’ as a major group of angiosperms Taxonomic Ranks of the Daisy Species Bellis perennis 1 Genus Bellis 15 • Binomial nomenclature or Latin name • Initial capital for the genus name (Bellis) & lower case for the specific name (perennis) • Italics in word processed text, underline in written exam essay – first appearance use full name, then B. perennis • These text rules apply to all biology No. of members: Taxonomic Ranks of the Daisy • Plant family names end ‘aceae’ • Families made up of many genera • Name often derived from the first genus described, e.g. Aster • Initial capital but italics not needed for family names Genus Bellis 15 Family Asteraceae 23,000 No. of members: Taxonomic Ranks of the Daisy • Plant order names end ‘ales’ • Initial capital but italics not needed for order names Family Asteraceae 23,000 Order Asterales 27,500 No. of members: Ranunculaceae Chenopodiaceae Caryophyllaceae Polygonaceae Brassicaceae (Cruciferae) Rosaceae Fabaceae (Leguminosae) Onagraceae Geraniaceae Apiaceae (Umbelliferae) Boraginaceae Lamiaceae (Labiatae) Scrophulariaceae Asteraceae (Compositae) Juncaceae Cyperaceae Poaceae (Gramineae) Asparagaceae Orchidaceae 19 Major Plant Families • Account for over 70% of all Ceredigion wildflowers • Recognition of families is an aid to field identification • Floras list in ‘taxonomic order’, with most similar adjacent Ranunculaceae Early in Taxonomic Order Ranunculaceae Chenopodiaceae Caryophyllaceae Polygonaceae Brassicaceae (Cruciferae) Rosaceae Fabaceae (Leguminosae)

OrchidaceaeMonocotsEudicotsEudicots Ranunculus ficaria Celandine Ranunculaceae: some members Anemone nemorosa Wood anemone Helleborus nigra Hellebore Clematis vitalba Clematis R. flammula Spearwort R. hederaceus Water-crowfoot Aquilegia  caerulea Columbine Ranunculaceae Relictual (‘ancestral’) floral features Many separate stamens & carpels Scanning electron micrograph image of buttercup sexual organs Ovaries can consist of fused carpels • Fused carpels → chambers in ovary Fruit from ovary with one carpel Fruit from ovary with multiple carpels Caryophyllaceae • Some derived (‘advanced’) floral features • 5 bifurcated petals • Fewer carpels & stamens • Carpels fused in ovary • Stitchwort Lychnis flos-cuculi Ragged robin Silene dioica Red campion Spergula arvensis Corn spurrey Silene maritima Sea campion Caryophyllaceae: some members Wing petal Wing petal Keel petal Standard petal Fabaceae Gorse • 3rd largest family • All legumes – some fix nitrogen via relationship with Rhizobium, e.g., pea, soya, peanut, clover… • Derived floral features • Zygomorphic petals ➔ Fabaceae Actinomorphic – radial symmetry, relictual Zygomorphic – bilateral symmetry, derived Wing petal Wing petal Keel petal Standard petal Asteraceae last of dicots in taxonomic order Ranunculaceae Chenopodiaceae Caryophyllaceae Polygonaceae Brassicaceae (Cruciferae) Rosaceae Fabaceae (Leguminosae)

OrchidaceaeMonocotsEudicotsEudicots Asteraceae • Largest dicot family (2nd overall) • Many derived floral features • Compound flowers of ‘florets’ with own floral parts • ‘Inferior’ ovaries Dandelion Florets Asteraceae • Compound flowers of ‘florets’ with own floral parts Helianthus annuus Sunflower Receptacle Asteraceae Florets• Dandelion • ‘Inferior’ ovaries • ‘Superior’ ovary ancestral • Ovary sits above other floral organs • Floral parts attach to receptacle under ovary • ‘Inferior’ ovary sits below other floral organs • Floral parts attach to a point above the ovary • Sepals • Petals • Stamens • Carpels Example of Fruit From Inferior Ovary Stamen cluster Pomegranate fruit “berry”: from inferior ovary • ‘Inferior’ ovary sits below other floral organs • Sepals • Petals • Stamens • Carpels Poaceae (monocots) after dicots in taxonomic order Ranunculaceae Chenopodiaceae Caryophyllaceae Polygonaceae Brassicaceae (Cruciferae) Rosaceae Fabaceae (Leguminosae) Onagraceae Geraniaceae Apiaceae (Umbelliferae) Boraginaceae Lamiaceae (Labiatae) Scrophulariaceae Asteraceae (Compositae) Juncaceae Cyperaceae Poaceae (Gramineae) Asparagaceae OrchidaceaeMonocotsDicotsDicots Poaceae • Many derived floral features • Composed of florets in which floral parts are enclosed in ‘bracts’ • Most economically important family of plants – wheat, rice, maize, barley, sorghum, millet, oats, rye, sugarcane, bamboo… Sweet vernal grass Anther Stigma Asparagaceae • Many derived floral features • Monocot floral parts tend to be multiples of 3 • 4 or 5 in dicots Bluebell 6 anthers 6 petals Monocot & eudicot characters From Campbell & Reece Chapter 30 More monocot & eudicot characters From Campbell & Reece Chapter 30 Monocots >25% of angiosperms New Angiosperm Classification Basal angiosperms (formerly considered dicots) Eudicots >67% of angiosperms • Phylogenetic analysis began to revise traditional angiosperm classification in 1990s • Now evident that monocots & eudicots evolved from the (old) ‘dicots’ Summary • Plant family names end ‘aceae’ • Recognition of families aids ecological surveying • Knowledge of flower organs needed • Series of characters distinguish >25% of angiosperms as ‘monocots’ • Phylogenetic studies show monocots evolved from traditional ‘dicots’ • Traditional dicots now divided into ‘eudicots’ and ‘basal angiosperms’ Image acknowledgments Wikimedia Commons,
