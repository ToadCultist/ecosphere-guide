This plant is similar to duckweed but supersized. If you want to use this plant, you will have to make a larger air gap at the top of your ecosphere. I have known people who have had great success with this plant but have not used it myself. Like duckweed, this plant is great at filtering out chemicals in the water.

Organisms will feed off this plantâ€™s extensive root structure. I suggest adding a smaller one to your ecosphere to stop the top part from being too crowded and allowing the plant to have room to grow. One downside with this plant is they can do a little too well in an ecosphere and may absorb a lot of nutrients and it may grow to be quite big. I would only use this in larger ecospheres.
