This liverwort species is a bit of an enigma, it is almost always confused with pelia moss which is extremely slow growing and not at all suitable for ecospheres. Most sellers selling Monosolenium will actually be selling pelia, however it can be differentiated by the fact that there is a small ridge running down the thalluses (moss leaves) of Monosolenium while true pelia being more transparent without a ridge. If possible, buy the [tropica 1, 2 grow one](https://tropica.com/en/plants/plantdetails/18747/18747) as I know they sell the correct stuff. You may wonder why go though all the trouble to get this plant? Its because its awesome stuff, it grows reasonably fast compared to other bryophytes and looks fantastic. It is also pretty hardy.
