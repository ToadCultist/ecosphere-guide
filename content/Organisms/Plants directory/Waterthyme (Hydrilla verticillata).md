This is in my opinion the best plant you could possibly use in an ecosphere, it has a particularly high rate of photosynthesis, coupled with its fast growth rate once established and tolerance for low lighting conditions it is objectively superior to most other plants at keeping the ecosystem stable. This plant can also be easily consumed by most species of mollusc providing a steady food supply while growing fast enough to not be completely eaten away. This plant also seems to be resistant to algal blooms, due to the fact that it can compete with algae's fast nutrient uptake.
