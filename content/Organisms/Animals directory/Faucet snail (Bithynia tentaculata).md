Faucet snails are similar in appearance to New Zealand mud snails but they are significantly larger. They are commonly found across Europe but are invasive in North America. In my experience, they tend to spend most of their time burrowed in the substrate. Like New Zealand mud snails, they are a pretty low impact species.
