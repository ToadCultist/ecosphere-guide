You will not find these snails naturally (unless you live in Malaysia). I have found that these common aquarium snails do very well in ecospheres. They are often found in ecospheres as a result of hitchhiking on plants. They burrow in the substrate, aerating it which makes them a fine addition to any ecosphere. I have been told that their population can go out of control in an aquarium but I have not experienced this in an ecosphere, so take that in mind if you plan on using these.
