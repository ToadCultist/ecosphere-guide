These larvae contribute basically nothing to the ecosphere and they will be seen wriggling around the jar and eventually die off due to no land or food source for the adult mosquitoes or midges once they hatch. These can be found in pretty much any stagnant water source and are usually tinted yellow or red (midge larva are red).
